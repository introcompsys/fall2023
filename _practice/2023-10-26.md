**integrative 2**: The PR title must be `practice-2023-10-26` verbatim to get the double credit

create a `midterm.md` file in your kwl repo with 10 mutliple choice questions that cover topics from at least 5 different class sessions. Each question should have 4 options, 1 correct and 3 that represent a reasonable, but incorrect idea someone may have. All 10 questions should check understanding of key *concepts*, not only terminology or the name of a command. For each option explain why it is/not correct in a way that would help clarify someone's confusion if they had picked that answer instead of the correct answer. Each solution block must contain a link to the applicable class notes.
