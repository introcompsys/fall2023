On Seawulf, modfiy {index}`main.c` from class to accept the integer as a command line argument instead of via input while running the program. [See this tutorial for an example](http://crasseux.com/books/ctutorial/argc-and-argv.html). 
5. Write a bash script {index}`demo_test.sh` that runs your compiled program for each integer from 10 to 30 (syntax for a range is `{start..end}` so this would be `{10..30}`)
6. Write an sbatch script, {index}`batchrun.sh` to run your script  on a compute node and save the output to a file. The sbatch script should compile and link the program and then call the script. [see the options](https://web.uri.edu/hpc-research-computing/using-seawulf/#sbatch)
7. use [scp](https://www2.stat.duke.edu/comp/security/scp_man.html) to download your modified main, script files, and output to your local computer and include them in your kwl repo.
