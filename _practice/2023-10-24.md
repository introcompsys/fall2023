1. Update your KWL Chart learned column with what you've learned
2. Write a bash script that you can run in your group repo to generate a file with a list of all of your PRs and PR reviews (you may go in and assign yourself to these PRs to make this easier). Save the script as {index}`groupcontributions.sh` and its output as {index}`group_contributions-YYYY-MM-DD.md` in your KWL repo.
