1. Describe a type of project where it would be worth it for you to learn a language you have never used before in {index}`newlanguage.md` This should be based in what types of features for the language your project would require and/or what would contribute to the long term health of the project.
2. Learn about one of the following languages that you have not used before: [R](https://www.r-project.org/), [Julia](https://julialang.org/), [Clojure](https://clojure.org/guides/getting_started), [Zig](https://ziglang.org/), [Go](https://go.dev/), [erlang](https://www.erlang.org/), [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/) or another language you are curious about that appeared in the Developer survey. For example you might be interest in the [top paying languages](https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2023/#technology-top-paying-technologies). Use the official documentation.  Answer the following questions in {index}`languagelearning.md`:

    ```
    1. What is this language designed for?
    2. What Programming paradigm(s) does it support?
    3. Give at least 1 example of a programming language that experience in would make it easy to learn this language and explain why.

Actually try out one of the langauges above in a new repo created from [this asssignment](https://classroom.github.com/a/qM3V3e5n). 


1. Setup the devcontainer to provide the compiler/interpreter for the language of your choice. See [features](https://containers.dev/features)
2. Add top extensions related to the language to the devcontainer. 
3. Add [gitignore](https://github.com/github/gitignore) file for that language
4. Write a hello world type program in the language and make sure it runs. 
5. Use the official documentation to figure out a common task in the language. You may use GitHub Co-pilot to write the code.  
6. Answer the questions in the README of the template repo.
