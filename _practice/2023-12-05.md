1.  Update your KWL chart.
1. Simulate a more computationally intensive program using the `sleep` function in C and compare the time of a threaded vs single threaded (ie serial, no intentional threading) version of the program. Include your two programs and the bash script to show how you tested it with notes on the performance in {index}`threaded.md` (to better illustrate the impact of the threads)
1. Learn about the system libraries in two languages (one can be C or Python, one must be something else). Find the name(s) of the library or libraries. In {index}`systeminteraction.md` summarize what types of support are shared or different?  What does that tell you about the language?
2.  Research examples of programs using multi-threading besides splitting up a single calculation for time reasons, include three examples in {index}`whymultithread.md`.
