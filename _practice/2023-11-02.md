1. create a new ssh key and configure it to your GitHub account
2. Install [ gcc](https://gcc.gnu.org/install/) locally and practice using it.  Repeat steps we did in class on your computer and then change the order of parameters; try skipping steps to produce errors, etc. Export the list of variations you tried and summarize what you learned as a list of tips and reminders on what the parameters do/why/when you would need them (or not) in {index}`gcctips.md`.  (to reinforce what we learned)
3. Write two short programs that do the same thing in different ways and compile them both to assembly (eg using a for vs while loop to sum numbers up to a number). Check the assembly to see if they produce the same thing or if it's different. Save your code (in code blocks) and notes about your findings in {index}`assemblycompare.md`
