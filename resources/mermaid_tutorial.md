flowchart TD
    A[blank] -->|blank| B(blank)
    B --> C{blank}
    C -->|blank| D[blank]
    C -->|blank| E[blank]
    C -->|blank| F[blank]
```

In Mermaid there are different styles for boxes with either square or round edges and the option to give a description of each item in its pipe.

So the code above actually looks like this in it's code block:

````
```{mermaid}
flowchart TD
    A[blank] -->|blank| B(blank)
    B --> C{blank}
    C -->|blank| D[blank]
    C -->|blank| E[blank]
    C -->|blank| F[blank]
```
