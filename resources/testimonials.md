# Testimonials from Fall 2023 students

The best way to succeed in this course is to start badges as early as possible. Waiting till the end of the semester to finish up a lot of it creates unnecessary stress and it is something that I regret doing myself. I would also recommend going over the notes after they are posted to reinforce what you learned during the class. All the topics build on each other so this is something I’m glad I did. Do your best to stay on top of the work early to make the end of the semester easier. If you do these you’ll have no trouble passing the class and you’ll definitely finish it being glad you took it.

The best way that you can succeed in CSC 392 is to practice with the course content and get ahead on the badges. Taking the time to complete badges is the best way to do this and the more consistently you can get your badges done, the more practice and skills you're going to improve with this course. Definitely work to get your explore and build badges out of the way early on because they will sneak up out of nowhere and make your life unnecessarily tough. The class is a great preview of what collaboration in an actual workplace might look like so make sure to actively participate to get the full lerning experience.
