Bring 3 misconceptions about course topics to class. 

This could be:
- things you thought before the semester and know better now
- things you thought at some point during the semester and had you stuck on a badge
- things you have heard someone else say that you now know is not true
- something you think is tricky and would confuse someone else

put them in your KWL repo on a branch linked to this issue in a file `misconceptions.md`
