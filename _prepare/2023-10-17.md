1. Read the notes from October 12. We will build on these directly in the future. **You need to have the `test` repo with the same status for lab on 10/13 and class on 10/17**  Make sure you have completed all of the steps in the github inclass repo from September too. 
1. Start recording notes on _how_ you use IDEs for the next couple of weeks using the template file below. We will come back to these notes in class later, but it is best to record over a time period instead of trying to remember at that time. Record which IDE(s) you use, what tasks you do, what features you use, what extensions, etc. Store your notes in your kwl repo in {index}`idethoughts.md` on an `ide_prep` branch. **This is prep for much later, it does not go in the October 17 experience badge branch**
