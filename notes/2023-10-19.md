# Why did we learn the plumbing commands?

You will not typically use them on a day to day basis, but they are a good way to see what happens at the interim steps and make sure that you have the right understanding of what git does.  

A **correct** understanding is essential for using more advanced features


While there is of course some content that we want you to know after this course, my goal is also to teach you process, by modeling it.  


No one will every know all of the things but you can be fast or slow at finding answers. 

And you can find correct answers, incorrect answers, or looks-okay-but-you-will-regret-this-later answers. 

```{important}
My goal is that you get good at *quickly* finding **correct** answers. 
```


## When is the blob created?  

First lets add some conent to revise a file
```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
echo "a sentence" >> about.md 
```

and then use git status to check the repo

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
git status
```

```{code-block} console
On branch main
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'.

Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git restore <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
	modified:   about.md

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
```
at this point file is changed, but it has only been changed in the working directory.  

git does not run in the background automatically. 

We can use `find` to inspect as we have, with `wc -l` to count the objects. 

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
find .git/objects/ -type f | wc -l
```

```{code-block} console
      36
```
we start with 36 
````{margin}
```{note}
You can have a different number here, the specific number is not important
```
````


Now we add the file to the staging area

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
git add .
```

and count the objects again


```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
find .git/objects/ -type f | wc -l
```

```{code-block} console
      37
```
and we see it increased.  So the blob object is created when we stage the file.  

This is how we can have a file that is both staged for commit and not staged for commit. 

Right now we have a version of the file that has been previously hashed and committed at various times, and the version that is both edited locally *and* hashed and stored for a future commit.  

Next we will edit the file again. 

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
echo "a sentence agian" >> about.md 
```

and check the status again 

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
git status
```

```{code-block} console
On branch main
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'.

Changes to be committed:
  (use "git restore --staged <file>..." to unstage)
	modified:   about.md

Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git restore <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
	modified:   about.md

```

Now there are 3 versions of this file encountered by `git status` (active, there are actually more in past commits):
- the version in the last commit 
- the version staged for commit 
- the version in the working directory


## How does git track file names?  

Let's trace it out?  First  we will look at our recent commits 

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
git log 
```

```{code-block} console
commit 042a42eb47c33ee43d793feb4d891a93e7460527 (HEAD -> main, origin/main, origin/HEAD)
Author: Sarah M Brown <brownsarahm@uri.edu>

Author: Sarah M Brown <brownsarahm@uri.edu>
Date:   Tue Sep 19 13:26:20 2023 -0400

    second fun fact

```

Now we can use the first four characters (the minimum) or more if needed to be unique to look at that commit object. 

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
git cat-file -p 042a
```

```{code-block} console
tree 11d53c24bb5d2bf2e3f645ef188f8bc75fa9c911
parent d76bc523443bda5a5daae2fe7fcfbf6fba71ae6d

committer Sarah M Brown <brownsarahm@uri.edu> 1695317219 -0400

begin organizing
```

Here, in the commit, we see that there are no file names.  So we can keep tracing, we will look at the tree object from this commit. 

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
git cat-file -p 11d5
```


```{code-block} console
040000 tree 95b60ce8cdec1bc4e1df1416e0c0e6ecbd3e7a8c	.github

```
Here in the tree we see that each line includes the name from the working directory of the file that the blob came from or the folder that is represented by that additional tree. 


Let's check a blob object for completeness. 

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
git cat-file -p b62d
```

```{code-block} console
Sarah Brown
2027
- i skied competitively in high school
- i started at URI in 2020
- I went to Northeastern

```
Note here that there is no mention of the file name, the file name is **only** in the tree. 


 
```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
git status
```

```{code-block} console
On branch main
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'.

Changes to be committed:
  (use "git restore --staged <file>..." to unstage)
	modified:   about.md

Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git restore <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
	modified:   about.md

```


## What is the index?

The staging area/index


```{code-cell} bash

```

## Why does it  show the help

```{important}
This was a real question from class and is a good question! 
```

Most command line tools are designed to show you the help, not only an error when you use it incorrectly. 

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
git stats
```

```{code-block} console
git: 'stats' is not a git command. See 'git --help'.

The most similar command is
	status
```

## Git References 

```{note}
I have commented out for now where the inspection of git tags did not go as expected.  I hope to fill this in with the answer and notify you later.

## Making a git tag 

We will work in the github-inclass repo for this. 
```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
cd ../github-inclass-fa23-brownsarahm/
```

The `git tag` command works a lot like `git branch`.  With no parameters it lists the current tags.  With options it can also create or manage them. 

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
git tag
```

If we provide a name for it, we can create a lightweight tag

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
git tag v1
```

A lightweight tag is just a pointer to a commit. 

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
git tag
```

```{code-block} console
v1
```

We can see the tag is added to the annotation on the commits  with git log. 

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
git log --pretty=oneline 
```

```{code-block} console

```


```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
git tag --help
```

We can also add tags at past commits by passing a commit hash. 

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
git tag v0 65e9
```

and see it the same way.  

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]

```

```{code-block} console

These create files in the .git direcotry with the hash in them

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
ls .git/refs/tags/
```

```{code-block} console
v0	v1
```


```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
cat .git/refs/tags/v0
```

```{code-block} console
65e9e39935be8400ef12cc9003592f12244b50da
```


Tags can be used with other git commands like `git log` to show only a subset of the commits. 

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
git log --pretty=oneline v0..v1
```

```{code-block} console
042a42eb47c33ee43d793feb4d891a93e7460527 (HEAD -> main, tag: v1, origin/main, origin/HEAD) begin organizing

5c8aaa9f2a129d551b8cb2cb294676f63c4af410 Merge pull request #5 from introcompsys/add-name
```

```{note}
I used that to generate a list of changes in the [class 11 release](https://github.com/introcompsys/fall2023/releases/tag/c11)
```

## What if I have changes I do not want to lose *or* commit yet 

We want to pusht the tag, but we cannot push right now: 

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
git push
```

```{code-block} console
To https://github.com/introcompsys/github-inclass-fa23-brownsarahm.git
 ! [rejected]        main -> main (fetch first)
error: failed to push some refs to 'https://github.com/introcompsys/github-inclass-fa23-brownsarahm.git'
hint: Updates were rejected because the remote contains work that you do
hint: not have locally. This is usually caused by another repository pushing
hint: to the same ref. You may want to first integrate the remote changes
hint: (e.g., 'git pull ...') before pushing again.
hint: See the 'Note about fast-forwards' in 'git push --help' for details.
```
because we have our local and remote main branches out of sync


```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
git pull
```

```{code-block} console

remote: Counting objects: 100% (9/9), done.
remote: Compressing objects: 100% (3/3), done.

error: Your local changes to the following files would be overwritten by merge:
	about.md
Please commit your changes or stash them before you merge.
Aborting
```

Pulling did not work either.  

However, technically the tags can be pushed anyway, even without pushing the rest of our files. 


```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
git push --tags
```

```{code-block} console
Total 0 (delta 0), reused 0 (delta 0), pack-reused 0
To https://github.com/introcompsys/github-inclass-fa23-brownsarahm.git
 * [new tag]         v0 -> v0
 * [new tag]         v1 -> v1
```

We can then see them in the browser: 

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
gh repo view --web
```

```{code-block} console
Opening github.com/introcompsys/github-inclass-fa23-brownsarahm in your browser.
```


## Using git to debug

```{note}
I am going to revise this later, to understand for now, refer to the [git book chapter](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Debugging-with-Git)
```

If you find a bug in your code and you do not know when it was introduced `git bisect` can help you perform a binary search over your commits to find the first commit that introduced the bug. 

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
git bisect start
```

```{code-block} console
status: waiting for both good and bad commits
```
It takes 2 inputs as separate calles after you start it a known bad commit and a known good commit.  

We will say that we know our current commit is bad. 

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
git bisect bad
```

```{code-block} console
status: waiting for good commit(s), bad commit known
```

And that `v0` tag was good.  
```{note}
This is a good use of tags!
```

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
git bisect good v0
```

```{code-block} console
Bisecting: 3 revisions left to test after this (roughly 2 steps)
error: Your local changes to the following files would be overwritten by checkout:
	about.md
Please commit your changes or stash them before you switch branches.
Aborting
```

Now that working directory update that we made comes back to get in the way. 

We have the option to commit or stash.  

## What if I want to keep changes, but not commit them yet? 

Stash creates git objects of content that you can recover later.  It works like a first-in-first-out queue by default and is a conceptually separate set of content from the commit history (though it is still stored in the `.git/` directory)

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
git stash
```

```{code-block} console
Saved working directory and index state WIP on main: 042a42e begin organizing
```

once we stash it, our working directory is clean and we can go back to debugging

## Binary searchiing with bisect 

Now we can tell it the good commit again

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
git bisect good v0
```

```{code-block} console
Bisecting: 3 revisions left to test after this (roughly 2 steps)
[768dec80c5e0734476d476ae83376c9c786b6450] Update about.md
```

What git does here is checks out the commit in the middle of the commits we labeled good and bad, this allows us to check whatever we were looking for and then we have to label each commit it checks out for us as good or bad.  

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
git bisect good
```

```{code-block} console
Bisecting: 1 revision left to test after this (roughly 1 step)
[bc281792d6ab62b153d7bf44f7985ec7cfc3b850] start organizing
```
If we say it is good, it takes the next commit to be halfway between this commit and the one labeled bad. 

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
git bisect bad
```

```{code-block} console
Bisecting: 0 revisions left to test after this (roughly 0 steps)
[756c4879c0447db20980f73a26bc2ba072e08a6d] second fun fact
```

When we label a commit bad, it checks out the commit between the current commit and the closest one labeled good


Here we do whatever we need to do to figure out if the currently checked out version is good or bad. 


And label this comit

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
git bisect bad
```

```{code-block} console
756c4879c0447db20980f73a26bc2ba072e08a6d is the first bad commit
commit 756c4879c0447db20980f73a26bc2ba072e08a6d
Author: Sarah M Brown <brownsarahm@uri.edu>
Date:   Tue Sep 19 13:26:20 2023 -0400

    second fun fact

 about.md | 2 ++
 1 file changed, 2 insertions(+)
```

In this case, once we label it bad, now git has enough informtion to tell us what commit was the first bad one and what changes were made in this commit.

This wil help us decide how to fix it. 

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
git status
```

```{code-block} console
HEAD detached at 756c487
You are currently bisecting, started from branch 'main'.
  (use "git bisect reset" to get back to the original branch)

nothing to commit, working tree clean
```

"detatched" HEAD means that the head pointer is set to a specific commit rather than a branch. 

When we are done, we can use reset to to back to main and then apply our fix. 

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
git bisect reset
```

```{code-block} console
Previous HEAD position was 756c487 second fun fact
Switched to branch 'main'
Your branch is behind 'origin/main' by 2 commits, and can be fast-forwarded.
  (use "git pull" to update your local branch)
```

## What about the stashed content

Now that we are on main with a clean working directory it is a good time to pull the remote changes. 

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
git pull
```

```{code-block} console
Updating 042a42e..4202c16
Fast-forward
 README.md                 | 37 +++++++++++++++++++------------------
 about.md => docs/about.md |  0
 2 files changed, 19 insertions(+), 18 deletions(-)
 rename about.md => docs/about.md (100%)
```

We can use `list` on `git stash` to see the stashed changes

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
git stash list
```

```{code-block} console
stash@{0}: WIP on main: 042a42e begin organizing
```

and then `apply` to apply them

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
git stash apply
```

```{code-block} console
On branch main
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'.

Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git restore <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
	modified:   docs/about.md

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
```

it updates the working directory but not the index by default. 

If we re stage the file

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
git add .
```

and and make more edits

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
echo "another edit" >> docs/about.md 
```

so that we have both staged and unstaged changes again

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
git status
```

```{code-block} console
On branch main
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'.

Changes to be committed:
  (use "git restore --staged <file>..." to unstage)
	modified:   docs/about.md

Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git restore <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
	modified:   docs/about.md

```

and stash this status

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
git stash
```

```{code-block} console
Saved working directory and index state WIP on main: 4202c16 fix readme to remove >
```



```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
git status
```

```{code-block} console
On branch main
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'.

nothing to commit, working tree clean
```

we now have 2 stashes

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
git stash list
```

```{code-block} console
stash@{0}: WIP on main: 4202c16 fix readme to remove >
stash@{1}: WIP on main: 042a42e begin organizing
```

we can apply the on in 0 to both the workign directory and the staging area with the `--index` option. 

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
git stash apply --index
```

```{code-block} console
On branch main
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'.

Changes to be committed:
  (use "git restore --staged <file>..." to unstage)
	modified:   docs/about.md

Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git restore <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
	modified:   docs/about.md
