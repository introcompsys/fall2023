# Linking and Object file binary representation

## Why is the linking step important?

Let's make an empty folder to work with.  I made my in my `inclass/sytems` folder. 


```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
mkdir cexample
```

and then go in that new folder

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
cd cexample/
```

We are going to make two files, first 

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
nano main.c
```

and put this content in the file: 

```C
/* Used to illustrate separate compilation.
Created: Joe Zachary, October 22, 1992
Modified:
*/

#include <stdio.h>

void main () {
 int n;
 printf("Please enter a small positive integer: ");
 scanf("%d", &n);
 printf("The sum of the first n integers is %d\n", sum(n));
 printf("The product of the first n integers is %d\n", product(n));
}
```


And then make a second file: 

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
nano help.c
```

with the contents that describes two functions: 

```C
/* Used to illustrate separate compilation

Created: Joe Zachary, October 22, 1992
Modified:

*/

/* Requires that "n" be positive. Returns the sum of the
  first "n" integers. */

int sum (int n) {
 int i;
 int total = 0;
 for (i = 1; i <= n; i++)
  total += i;
 return(total);
}


/* Requires that "n" be positive. Returns the product of the
  first "n" integers. */

int product (int n) {
 int i;
 int total = 1;
 for (i = 1; i <= n; i++)
  total *= i;
 return(total);
}
```

First we can make the two objects:

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
gcc -Wall -g -c main.c 
```

but here we get an error:

```{code-block} console
main.c:8:1: warning: return type of 'main' is not 'int' [-Wmain-return-type]
void main () {
^
main.c:8:1: note: change return type to 'int'
void main () {
^~~~
int
main.c:12:52: error: implicit declaration of function 'sum' is invalid in C99
      [-Werror,-Wimplicit-function-declaration]
 printf("The sum of the first n integers is %d\n", sum(n));
                                                   ^
main.c:13:56: error: implicit declaration of function 'product' is invalid in C99
      [-Werror,-Wimplicit-function-declaration]
 printf("The product of the first n integers is %d\n", product(n));
                                                       ^
1 warning and 2 errors generated.
```


We can get around this, by telling main about the functions by adding
```C
int sum(int n);
int product (int n);
```
to the `main.c`

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
nano main.c 
```

so that it is like this: 
```C
/* Used to illustrate separate compilation.
Created: Joe Zachary, October 22, 1992
Modified:
*/

#include <stdio.h>
int sum(int n);
int product(int n);

void main () {
 int n;
 printf("Please enter a small positive integer: ");
 scanf("%d", &n);
 printf("The sum of the first n integers is %d\n", sum(n));
 printf("The product of the first n integers is %d\n", product(n));
}
```

Now we can make this object file
```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
gcc -Wall -g -c main.c 
```

```{code-block} console
main.c:10:1: warning: return type of 'main' is not 'int' [-Wmain-return-type]
void main () {
^
main.c:10:1: note: change return type to 'int'
void main () {
^~~~
int
1 warning generated.
```
we get a warning, but that's okay

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
ls
```

```{code-block} console
help.c	main.c	main.o
```

If we try to make this an executable, we cannot because then it looks for what those functions are supposed to do, but it cannot do that yet. 

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
gcc -o demo main.o -lm
```

```{code-block} console
Undefined symbols for architecture x86_64:
  "_product", referenced from:
      _main in main.o
  "_sum", referenced from:
      _main in main.o
ld: symbol(s) not found for architecture x86_64
clang: error: linker command failed with exit code 1 (use -v to see invocation)
```

So, we make the object file for the helper functions

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
gcc -Wall -g -c help.c 
```


Now, we can finally link and make it executble:

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
gcc -o demo main.o help.o -lm
```

and we can run our program

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
./demo 
```

```{code-block} console
Please enter a small positive integer: 5
The sum of the first n integers is 15
The product of the first n integers is 120
```


````{tip}
One reason we split code is to make it readable, but another reason is what we just did.  We can compile each file separately, when your code is large and compiling takes a long time, splitting it will mean you only have to recompile the file(s) you have recently changed and relink, instead of recompiling everything.
````

If we edit, 


```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
nano main.c
```

to look like the following: 

```C
/* Used to illustrate separate compilation.
Created: Joe Zachary, October 22, 1992
Modified:
*/

#include <stdio.h>
int sum(int n);
int product(int n);

void main () {
 int n;
 printf("Hello! Please enter a small positive integer: ");
 scanf("%d", &n);
 printf("The sum of the first n integers is %d\n", sum(n));
 printf("The product of the first n integers is %d\n", product(n));
}
```

We added an `!` so it is just different. 

If we run again, it is not different. 


```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
./demo 
```

```{code-block} console
Please enter a small positive integer: 7
The sum of the first n integers is 28
The product of the first n integers is 5040
```

Now, we need to recompile the main file. 

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
gcc -Wall -g -c main.c 
```

```{code-block} console
main.c:10:1: warning: return type of 'main' is not 'int' [-Wmain-return-type]
void main () {
^
main.c:10:1: note: change return type to 'int'
void main () {
^~~~
int
1 warning generated.
```

and then relink them into an executable

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
gcc -o demo main.o help.o -lm
```

for the changes to apply

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
./demo 
```

```{code-block} console
Hello! Please enter a small positive integer: 8
The sum of the first n integers is 36
The product of the first n integers is 40320
```

We see that this makes the  executble and the two object files

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
ls -la
```

```{code-block} console
total 136
drwxr-xr-x  7 brownsarahm  staff    224 Nov  7 12:53 .
drwxr-xr-x  9 brownsarahm  staff    288 Nov  7 12:37 ..
-rwxr-xr-x  1 brownsarahm  staff  50072 Nov  7 12:53 demo
-rw-r--r--  1 brownsarahm  staff    474 Nov  7 12:40 help.c

-rw-r--r--  1 brownsarahm  staff   2400 Nov  7 12:53 main.o
```

We can change the name of the executable with the `-o` option. 


```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
gcc -o sumProd main.o help.o -lm
```



```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
./sumProd 
```

```{code-block} console
Hello! Please enter a small positive integer: 8

## Experience Report Evidence

## Questions After Today's Class 

### Why didn't python work locally for me?

On Windows, you may need to reinstall GitBash with different settings. 

### Can I get a bunch of binary representations of letters and use it to write to a file in characters?

yes

### Are we implementing more function/loops in the future?

More can be done, but not a lot more in class time

### What would be a case where we need to use bytes conversion in our code?


If you need to compress data to work in a low memory environment. 


### Why would I want to write and compile code from a Terminal and not from and IDE? 

If you are working on a server where you do not have an IDE available. Or if you are doing something really quick. 


### Is it ok that I see blobs in the object file, not just od characters? 

Yes! Different computers will make different amounts of progress at this


### what else can i do with c / python in the terminal

You can do anything the langague can do through a terminal. We had programming before we had modern IDEs. 

### Does the order of the compiling command matter?

This is a practice badge question. 


### What benefit is it to create python scripts on the server?

If it is processing large amount of data or if it has complex calculations that are intensive. 


### Is there a way to view a text file in raw bytes with a bash command?


the terminal cannot show it as the raw bytes, but we will see some ways to view the file in different representations. 


### Is it better to use python in the terminal?

it is not better, it is just another option.  Having more options also helps you see the how it really works. 


### Most people will tell you python is extremely slow, so why are we still using it? 

Python is slower than C, but it is much easier to read than fast lanaguages.  So it is often faster to write.  It also has more effecitve, well written libraries and consistent performance. It is essentially the only option for modern effecitve AI models unless you are writing it all from scratch with is generally intractable.  



## Good Explore badge questions

- how would linking a third file to the executable affect how it runs, if it has nothing to do with the res to the code
