# What is a commit number? 

## Announcements 

```{important}
follow the prepare for 10/19 to get announcements from the repo commit messages

```



## What is a hash?


a hash is:
- a fixed size value that can be used to represent data of arbitrary sizes
- the *output* of a hashing function
- often fixed to a hash table



Common examples of hashing are lookup tables and encryption with a cyrptographic hash.


A hashing function could be really simple, to read off a hash table, or it can
be more complex.



For example:

```{list-table}

* - Hash
  - content
* - 0
  - Success
* - 1
  - Failure
```

+++



If we want to represent the status of a program running it has two possible
outcomes: success or failure. We can use the following hash table and a function
that takes in the content and returns the corresponding hash. Then we could pass
around the 0 and 1 as a single bit of information that corresponds to the outcomes.

+++



This lookup table hash works here.  

+++



In a more complex scenario, imagine trying to hash all of the new terms you learn
in class. 


+++

A table would be hard for this, because until you have seen them all, you
do not know how many there will be.  A more effective way to hash this, is to
derive a *hashing function* that is a general strategy.



+++




A *cyrptographic* hash is additionally:
- unique
- not reversible
- similar inputs hash to very different values so they appear uncorrelated


+++

What are some ways a hash could be used? 


+++



Hashes can then be used for a lot of purposes:
- message integrity (when sending a message, the unhashed message and its hash are both sent; the message is real if the sent message can be hashed to produce the same has)
- password verification (password selected by the user is hashed and the hash is stored; when attempting to login, the input is hashed and the hashes are compared)
- file or data identifier (eg in git)


+++



## Hashing in passwords 

+++


Passowrds can be encrypted and the encrypted information is stored, then when you submit a candidate password it can compare the hash of the submitted password to the hash that was stored.  Since the hashing function is nonreversible, they cannot see the password.  


+++


Some sites are negligent and store passwords unencrypted, if your browser warns you about such a site, proceed with caution and definitely do not reuse a password you ever use. (you *should never* reuse passwords, but especially do not if there is a warning)

+++


An attacker who gets one of those databases, cannot actually read the passwords, but they could build a lookup table.  For example, "password" is a bad password because it has been hashed in basically every algorithm and then the value of it can be reversed.  Choosing an uncommon password makes it less likely that your password exists in a lookup table. 

+++


```
echo "password" | git hash-object --stdin
```

```


+++




## Hashing in Git

+++



In git we hash both the content directly to store it in the database (.git) directory
and the commit information.  


+++


Recall, when we were working in our toy repo we created an empty repository and
then added content directly, we all got the same hash, but when we used git
commit our commits had different hashes because we have different names and
made the commits at different seconds. We also saw that *two* entries were
created in the `.git` directory for the commit.



### Git hashes are cryptographic

This is a Secure Hashing Algorithm that is derived from cryptography.  Because
it is secure, no set of mathematical options can directly decrypt an SHA-1  hash.
It is designed so that any possible content that we put in it returns a unique
key. It uses a combination of bit level operations on the content to produce the
unique values.

We can use the git hashing algorithm without writing to the repo too: 

````{margin}
```{note}
I changed the formatting here to be easier to differentiate input and output. 
```
````

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
echo "what's up" | git hash-object --stdin
```

### Git hashing algorithm 

Git was originally designed to use SHA-1. 


The SHA-1 Algorithm hashes content into a fixed length of 160 bits.


 This means
it can produce $2^160$ different hashes. Which makes the probability of a collision very low.


```{epigraph}
The number of randomly hashed objects needed to ensure a 50% probability of a single collision is about $2^{80}$ (the formula for determining collision probability is $p = (n(n-1)/2) * (1/2^160))$. $2^{80}$ is 1.2 x 1024 or 1 million billion billion. That’s 1,200 times the number of grains of sand on the earth.

-- [A SHORT NOTE ABOUT SHA-1 in the Git Documentation](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Revision-Selection)

```

git uses the SHA hash primarily for uniuqeness, not privacy


+++

It does provide some *security* assurances, because we can check the content
against the hash to make sure it is what it matches.



Then the [SHA-1 collision attack](https://shattered.io/) was discovered

+++

 Git switched to hardened HSA-1 in response to a collision.


>  In that case it adjusts the SHA-1 computation to result in a safe hash. This means that it will compute the regular SHA-1 hash for files without a collision attack, but produce a special hash for files with a collision attack, where both files will have a different unpredictable hash.
[from](https://crypto.stackexchange.com/questions/44141/what-is-hardened-sha-1-how-does-it-work-and-how-much-protection-does-it-offer).

+++

[they will change again soon](https://git-scm.com/docs/hash-function-transition/)


GitHub *uses* git, it is not an alternative implementation or a fork, so yes
it will switch too. The developers at GitHub an other git hosts are among the most impacted by
the change since they write code that directly interacts with git objects. 


### Remember we have many more git objects than commits

### Workign with git hashes

Mostly, a shorter version of the commit is sufficient to be unique, so we can use those to refer to commits by just a few characters:
- minimum 4
- must be unique

Git log by default shows us the full length

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
cd github-inclass-fa23-brownsarahm/
```

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
git log
```

For most project 7 characters is enough and by default, git will give you 7 digits if you use `--abbrev-commit` and git will automatically use more if needed.


```{code-cell} bash

Note: switching to 'bc28179'.

You are in 'detached HEAD' state. You can look around, make experimental
changes and commit them, and you can discard any commits you make in this
state without impacting any branches by switching back to a branch.

If you want to create a new branch to retain commits you create, you may
do so (now or later) by using -c with the switch command. Example:

  git switch -c <new-branch-name>

Or undo this operation with:

  git switch -

Turn off this advice by setting config variable advice.detachedHead to false

## How do we get to the alphanumeric hashes we see? 

Let's build this up with some review

+++





### What is a Number ?


+++



a mathematical object used to count, measure and label


+++

## What is a number system?



While numbers represent **quantities** that conceptually, exist all over, the numbers themselves are a cultural artifact. For example, we all have a way to represent a single item, but that can look very different. 

+++

for example I could express the value of a single item in different ways: 
- 1
- I

+++
### Hindu Arabic
In modern, western cultures, our number system is called the  hindu-arabic system, it consists of a set of **numerals**: 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9 and uses a **place based** system with **base 10**. 


+++

#### Where does the name come from? 

- invented by Hindu mathematicians in India 600 or earlier
- called "Arabic" numerals in the West because Arab merchants introduced them to Europeans
- slow adoption


+++

#### Numerals 
are the visual characters used to represent quantities


+++


#### Place based 

We use a **place based** system. That means that the position or place of the symbol changes its meaning. So 1, 10, and 100 are all different values. This system is also a decimal system, or base 10. So we refer to the places and the ones ($10^0$), the tens ($10^1$), the hundreds($10^2$), etc for all powers of 10.  


Number systems can use different characters, use different strategies for representing larger quantities, or both. 


+++


### Roman Numerals

is a number system that uses different numerals and is not a place based system


+++


There are symbols for specific values: 1=I, V=5, X=10, L =50, C = 100, D=500, M = 1000. 


Not all systems are place based, for example Roman numerals. 
In this system the subsequent symbols are either added or subtracted, with no (nonidentity) multipliers based on position.  Instead if the symbol to right is the same or smaller, add the two together, if the left symbol is smaller, subtract it from the one on the right. 



+++


Then 
- III = 1+1+1 = 3 
- IV = -1 + 5 = 4
- VI = 5+1 = 6 
- XLIX = -10 + 50 -1 +10 = 49.



This feel hard because it is unfamiliar

+++

## Different Bases


+++


### Decimal


To represent larger numbers than we have digits on we have a base (10) and then.

+++

$$10 = 10*1 + 1*0$$

$$22 = 10*2 + 1*2 $$


we have the ones  ($10^0) place, tens ($10^1$) place, hundreds ($10^2) place etc.  


+++


### Binary


Binary is any base two system, and it can be represented using any different characters.  



Binary number systems have origins in  ancient cultures:
- Egypt (fractions) 1200 BC
- China 9th century BC
- India 2nd century BC


+++


In computer science we use binary because mechanical computers began using relays (open/closed) to implement logical (boolean) operations and then digital computers use on and off in their circuits.  


+++


We represent binary using the same hindu-arabic symbols that we use for other numbers, but only the 0 and 1(the first two). We also keep it as a place-based number system so the places are the ones($2^0$), twos ($2^1$), fours ($2^2$), eights ($2^3$), etc for all powers of 2.


+++


so in binary, the number of characters in the word binary is 110.  


+++



$$ 10 => 2*1 + 1*0 = 2$$
so this 10 in binary  is 2 in decimal


+++

$$ 1001 => 8*1 + 4*0 + 2*0 + 1*1  = 9$$

+++


### Octal


+++


Is base 8. This too has history in other cultures, not only in computer science.  It is rooted in cultures that counted using the spaces *between* fingers instead of counting using fingers.


+++


This numbering system was popular in 6 bit and 12 bit computers, but is has origins before that. Native Americans using the Yuki Language (based in what is now California)[used an octal system because they count using the spaces between fingers](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2686959?origin=crossref&seq=1#metadata_info_tab_contents)
and speakers of the
[ Pamean languages in Mexico ](http://linguistics.berkeley.edu/~avelino/Avelino_2006.pdf) count on knuckles in a closed fist.
Europeans debated using decimal vs octal in the 1600-1800s for various reasons because 8 is better for math mostly. It is also found in Chinese texts dating to 1000BC.


+++


$$ 10 = > 8*1 + 1*0 = 8$$
so 10 in octal is 8 in decimal

$$ 401 => 64*4 + 8*0 + 1*1 = 257$$

+++




As in binary we use hindu-arabic symbols, 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7 (the first eight).  Then nine is 11.


+++



In computer science we use octal a lot because it reduces every 3 bits of a number in binary to a single character.  So for a large number, in binary say `101110001100` we can change to `5614` which is easier to read, for a person.


+++



### Hexadecimal




base 16, commonin CS because its 4 bits. we use 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,A,B,C,D,E,F. 


+++

This is commonly used for representing colors

+++

 <input type="color" id="colorpicker" value="#0000ff">

+++



This is how the git hash is 160 bits, or 20 bytes (one byte is 8 bits) but we represent it as 40 characters.  160/4=40.

## Questions After Today's Class 

### What might the password table looklike? 

You can check your own passwords against a collection of breech-revealed passwords, or download such a table at [haveibeenpwned](https://haveibeenpwned.com/Passwords)

Conceptually it could be as simmpel as 2 columns: 

```{list-table}
* - password
  - hash
* - ... 
  - ...
```


### Will we have to keep creating bigger and bigger number systems when computers get too fast at brute forcing hashes?

Most systems lock people out after a few tries to try to contol this, but potentially. 

This is also why we typically have 2 factors now. 


### Are the letters used in hexadecimal representation global? Like if all countries that may not use english have to use the english characters in hex A,B,C,D,E,F?

The letters we use are not limited to English. The English alphabet descends largely from the latin alphabet, as do many other European languages.  Further, since globalization, even some languages that historically had their own alphabets have adopted the English alphabet or one that is very similar. 

Historically people may have used others for hex, but in programming contexts we all use the same latin alphabet .

### Why are numbers so complicated?

Fundamentally, counting can happen in many different ways.  What we talked about today is abstractions and representations that have been developed over 1000s of years over the entire planet.  

People are complicated and vary a alot 

### What is the main difference between hash tables and hash functions? 

Strictly speaking, a hash function could be used to produce a hash table, a hash table is sort of a special case. 


A hash function tells how to produce the hash from the input. A hash table could assign hashes to content arbitrarily. 

### If the word "password" hash has been easily reverised, couldn't that just be done with every word in a language?

Yes, it could, that is why we have rules about what makes a good password.  That increases the possible options.  

There are a lot of words in a language, but it's a lot less than the total number of valid pass words, which do not have to be meaningful and typically can be any mix of letters in upper (26) or lower (+26) case, numbers (+10), or special characters (maybe another +20 or more). This means a password of length $d$ can be $26*2+10+20 = 82^d$ options.  Even for just length 2 there are then 6724 possible options.  For length 4 there are over 45 million.  So once you allow long passwords that are 30+ characters, it becomes really hard to store all of those options. 


### What exactly is a relay?

We will see this later when we talk more about hardware.  It is an electrically operated switch.

the [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relay) article also has an animation


###  Are there any hashing algorithms that use numerical systems greater than base 16?

The hashing algorithm does not necessarily select a specific base. For example the SHA-1 algorithm is defined using a series of bitwise and mathematical operations on the binary representation of the content: 
- split the messages into batches of length 512 bits
- break into 32 bit words
- xor
- and
- comparisons (if statments)
- bit shifts
- add
- or


you can see the [full psuedocode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-1#:~:text=2jmj7l5rSw0yVb/vlWAYkK/YBwk%3D-,SHA%2D1%20pseudocode,-%5Bedit%5D) for the algorithm 


Any base can be used to write out the strings. 16 is the highest commonly used, but for example the [wikipedia article on SHA-1 uses both base 64 and 16 in the examples](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-1#:~:text=%5Bedit%5D-,Example%20hashes,-%5Bedit%5D) 

### How would a developer create a function to hash passwords and store them securely?


In general, a developer would not develop a new hash function, you wouls use an existing one. Increasingly, authentication standards or using other authentication tools are common.

### What are good practices for adding authentication to my program?

This could be a good explore badge or potentially even a build on this topic 

### I want to learn more about encryption

If you make this a little more specific it could be a great explore badge.  You could try out an encryption library or read and write a summary or something else that makes sense to you. 


### Hashing and Quantum computing 
- Once quantum computing is more prominent, will hashing algorithms change because now it will can be both 0 and 1?
- Will current hashing algorithms be safe against quantum computing?

A good answer to this would rely on multiple sources and some independent reasoning.
