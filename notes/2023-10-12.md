# How does git create a commit?

Today we will dig into how git really works.  This will be a deep dive and provide a lot of details about how git creates a commit.  It will conceptually reinforce important concepts and practically give you some ideas about how you might fix things when things go wrong.  




Later, we will build on this more on the practical side, but these **concepts** are very important for making sense of the more practical aspects of fixing things in git.  




This deep dive in git is to help you build a correct, flexbile understanding of git so that you can use it independently and efficiently. The plumbing commands do not need to be a part of your daily use of git, but they are the way that we can dig in and see what *actually* happens when git creates a commit. 


 

Inspecting a system's components is a really good way to understand it and correctly understanding it will impact your ability to ask good questions and even look up the right thing to do when you need to fix things. 




Also, looking at the parts of git is a good way to reinforce specific design patterns that are common in CS in a practical way.  This means that today we will also: 
- get more practice with bash
- see a practical example of hashing
- reinforce through examples what a pointer does


## Review to set the stage 

Let's look at the github inclass repo.

```
cd Documents/inclass/systems/github-inclass-fa23-brownsarahm/
```

Recall: git stores important content in *files* that it uses like variables. 

All of gits files, that is uses to perform the version control system actions are in the `.git` directory.  Since this starts with a `.` it is "hidden" so to  see it we use the `-a` option on `ls`. 


```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ['skip-execution']

ls -a
```

```{code-block} console
.			LICENSE.md		helper_functions.py
..			README.md		important_classes.py
.git			about.md		setup.py
.github			abstract_base_class.py	tests
API.md			alternative_classes.py
CONTRIBUTING.md		docs
```

Inside there we can see the files: 


```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ['skip-execution']
ls .git
```


```{code-block} console
COMMIT_EDITMSG	REBASE_HEAD	index		packed-refs
FETCH_HEAD	config		info		refs
HEAD		description	logs
ORIG_HEAD	hooks		objects
```

For example:

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ['skip-execution']
cat .git/HEAD 
```

```{code-block} console
ref: refs/heads/main
```
holds the current branch and points to another file that holds the commit value

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ['skip-execution']
cat .git/refs/heads/main 
```

```{code-block} console
042a42eb47c33ee43d793feb4d891a93e7460527
```

we also see the config file

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ['skip-execution']
cat .git/config 
```

```{code-block} console
[core]
	repositoryformatversion = 0
	filemode = true
	bare = false
	logallrefupdates = true
	ignorecase = true
	precomposeunicode = true
[remote "origin"]
	url = https://github.com/introcompsys/github-inclass-fa23-brownsarahm.git
	fetch = +refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/origin/*
[branch "main"]
	remote = origin
	merge = refs/heads/main
[branch "1-create-an-about-file"]
	remote = origin
	merge = refs/heads/1-create-an-about-file
[branch "fun_fact"]
	remote = origin
	merge = refs/heads/fun_fact
```
that stores information about the different branches and remotes. 


```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ['skip-execution']
ls -a
```



```{code-block} console
.			LICENSE.md		helper_functions.py
..			README.md		important_classes.py
.git			about.md		setup.py
.github			abstract_base_class.py	tests
API.md			alternative_classes.py
CONTRIBUTING.md		docs
```


`.gitignore` is a file in the working direcotry that contains alist of files and patterns to not track. 


```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ['skip-execution']
cd ../tiny-book/
ls -a
```

```{code-block} console
.			_config.yml		markdown.md
..			_toc.yml		notebooks.ipynb
.git			intro.md		references.bib
.gitignore		logo.png		requirements.txt
_build			markdown-notebooks.md
```


```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ['skip-execution']
cat .gitignore 
```

```{code-block} console
_build/
```

Remmeber the `.gitignore` file lives **outside** of the `.git` directory because it is intended to be manually edited by the user, instead of written to by the `git` program. 



## Creating a repo from scratch

---

We will start in the top level course directory.
```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ['skip-execution']
cd ..
```

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ['skip-execution']
ls
```

```{code-block} console
fa23-kwl-brownsarahm		tiny-book
github-inclass-fa23-brownsarahm
```
Yours should also have your group repo, your messy folder, etc.  


We can create an empty repo from scratch using `git init <path>`

[Last time](gitinit) we used an existing directory like `git init .`

We will make a new directory for our repo: 

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ['skip-execution']
git init test
```

````{margin}
```{note}

[we get this message again, see context from last week](https://introcompsys.github.io/fall2023/notes/2023-09-28.html#retiring-racist-language)

```
````

```{code-block} console
hint: Using 'master' as the name for the initial branch. This default branch name
hint: is subject to change. To configure the initial branch name to use in all
hint: of your new repositories, which will suppress this warning, call:
hint: 
hint: 	git config --global init.defaultBranch <name>
hint: 
hint: Names commonly chosen instead of 'master' are 'main', 'trunk' and
hint: 'development'. The just-created branch can be renamed via this command:
hint: 
hint: 	git branch -m <name>
Initialized empty Git repository in /Users/brownsarahm/Documents/inclass/systems/test/.git/
```

We can see what happened:
```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ['skip-execution']
ls
```

```{code-block} console
fa23-kwl-brownsarahm		test
github-inclass-fa23-brownsarahm	tiny-book
```
we see the new directory

then we can enter it

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ['skip-execution']
cd test/
```

and then rename the branch

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ['skip-execution']
git branch -m main
```
As usual, we will look at the status

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ['skip-execution']
git status
```

```{code-block} console
On branch main

No commits yet

nothing to commit (create/copy files and use "git add" to track)
```



Notice that there are no commits, and no origin. 


```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ['skip-execution']
ls .git
```

```{code-block} console
HEAD		description	info		refs
config		hooks		objects
```



## Searching the file system


We can use the bash command `find` to search the file *system* note that this does not search the **contents** of the files, just the names.


```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ['skip-execution']
find .git/objects/
```

```{code-block} console
.git/objects/
.git/objects//pack
.git/objects//info
```


we have a few items in that directory and the directory itself.

We can limit by type, to only files with the `-type` option set to `f`


```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ['skip-execution']
find .git/objects/ -type f
```



And we have no results. We have no objects yet. Because this is an empty repo 


## Creating Git Blob Objects Directly

There are 3 types:
- blob objects: the content of your files (data)
- tree objects: stores file names and groups files together (organization)
- Commit Objects: stores information about the sha values of the snapshots


```{mermaid}

classDiagram
    class tree{
    List: 
      - hash: blob
      - string: type
      - string:file name 
    }
    class commit{
        hash: parent
        hash: tree
        string: message
        string: author 
        string: time
    }
    class blob{
        binary: contents
    }
    class object{
        hash: name

    }
    object <|-- blob
    object <|-- tree
    object <|-- commit
```

All git objects are files stored with the name that is the hash of the content in the file


Let's create our first git object.  git uses hashes as the key. We give the hashing function some content, it applies the algorithm and returns us the hash as the reference to that object.  We can also write to our .git directory  with  this.


The `git hash-object` function works on files, but we do not have any files yet.  We can create a file, but we do not have to.  Remememer, **everything** is a file. 

We can put content into the stdout file with `echo`

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ['skip-execution']
echo "test content"
```

```{code-block} console
test content
```

which shows on our terminal. We can us a pipe to connect the stdout of on command to the stdin of the next. 

and we can use a pipe to connect std out of one command to stdin of the next command.  Then we can use the `--stdin` option to tell git hash-object to read from there. 

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ['skip-execution']
echo "test content" | git hash-object -w --stdin
```
````{margin}
```{important}
pipes are an important content too. we're seeing them in context of real uses, and we will keep seing them. Pipes connect the std out of one command to the std in of the next.
```
````


We can break down this command: 
- `git hash-object` would take the content you handed to it and merely return the unique key
- `-w` option tells the command to also write that object to the database
- `--stdin` option tells git hash-object to get the content to be processed from stdin instead of a file
- the `|` is called a pipe (what we saw before was a redirect) it pipes a _process_ output into the next command
- `echo` would write to stdout, withthe pip it passes that to std in of the `git-hash`

```
d670460b4b4aece5915caf5c68d12f560a9fe3e4
```

and we can check if it wrote to the directory.
```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ['skip-execution']
find .git/objects/ -type f
```

```{code-block} console
.git/objects//d6/70460b4b4aece5915caf5c68d12f560a9fe3e4
```
and we see a file that it was supposed to have!



This file contains binary content that is hard to read.  Fortunately, git provides a utility. We can use `cat-file` to use the object by referencing at least 4 characters that are unique from the full hash, not the file name.

`cat-file` requires *an* option, we have used 2 so far: 
- `-p` is for pretty print
- `-t` is for type

We can then view the type of this object
```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ['skip-execution']
git cat-file -t d670
```

```{code-block} console
blob
```
 and its actual content


```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ['skip-execution']
git cat-file -p d670
```


```{code-block} console
test content
```

This is the content that we put in, as expected. 



### Hashing a file

To hash content that corresponds to a file, we have to have a file first.  We can use a redirect `>` to send content from echo to a different file. 

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ['skip-execution']
echo "version 1" > test.txt
```

and store it,  by hashing it

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ['skip-execution']
git hash-object -w test.txt 
```

```{code-block} console
83baae61804e65cc73a7201a7252750c76066a30
```

we can look at what we have.


```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ['skip-execution']
find .git/objects/ -type f
```

```{code-block} console
.git/objects//d6/70460b4b4aece5915caf5c68d12f560a9fe3e4
.git/objects//83/baae61804e65cc73a7201a7252750c76066a30
```


Now this is the status of our repo. 
```{mermaid}
classDiagram
    class d67046{
        + "test content"
        +(blob)
    }
    class 83baae{
       + Version 1
       + (blob)
    }
```

We can check the type of files with `-t` and `git cat-file`

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ['skip-execution']
git cat-file -t 83ba
```

```{code-block} console
blob
```

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ['skip-execution']
git cat-file -t d670
```

```{code-block} console
blob
```

We have hashed content, but our git status is still saying no commits and only one untracked file. 

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ['skip-execution']
git status
```

```{code-block} console
On branch main

No commits yet

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
	test.txt

nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)
```


So far, even though we have hashed the object, git still thinks the file is untracked, because it is not in the tree and there are no commits that point to that part of the tree.

the workign directory and the git repo are not strictly the same thing, and can be different like this.  Mostly they will stay in closer relationship that we currently have unless we use plumbling commands, but it is good to build a solid understanding of how the `.git` directory relates to your working directory.


Notice, that we only have one file in the working directory. 

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ['skip-execution']
ls
```

```{code-block} console
test.txt
```

## Writing a tree

We can write a tree with the `write-tree` command

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ['skip-execution']
git write-tree
```

```
4b825dc642cb6eb9a060e54bf8d69288fbee4904
```


we can see the object exists 
```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ['skip-execution']
find .git/objects/ -type f
```

```{code-block} console
.git/objects//d6/70460b4b4aece5915caf5c68d12f560a9fe3e4
.git/objects//4b/825dc642cb6eb9a060e54bf8d69288fbee4904
.git/objects//83/baae61804e65cc73a7201a7252750c76066a30
```

we can verify that it is a tree


```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ['skip-execution']
git cat-file -t 4b82
```

```{code-block} console
tree
```

and look at the tree contents

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ['skip-execution']
git cat-file -p 4b82
```

but it is empty. 


We have a file that was created, `git write-tree` did *something* but we told it to write a file without putting anything in the index, or staging area, that it reads from.  


```{mermaid}
classDiagram
    class d67046{
        +"test content"
        +(blob)
    }
    class 83baae{
       +Version 1
       +(blob)
    }
    class 4b825d{
        +(tree)
    }
```

Now, we can add our file and its hashed object as it is to the index. 

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ['skip-execution']
git update-index --add --cacheinfo 100644 \
 83baae61804e65cc73a7201a7252750c76066a30 test.txt
```



the `\` lets us wrap onto a second line.

- this the plumbing command `git update-index` updates (or in this case creates an index, the staging area of our repository)
- the `--add` option is because the file doesn’t yet exist in our staging area (we don’t even have a staging area set up yet)
- `--cacheinfo` because the file we're adding isn’t in your directory but is in the database.
- in this case, we’re specifying a mode of 100644, which means it’s a normal file.
- then the hash object we want to add to the index (the content) in our case, we want the hash of the first version of the file, not the most recent one.
- finally the file name of that content


## A staging and snapshot edge case

Let's check git status again: 

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ['skip-execution']
git status
```

```{code-block} console
On branch main

No commits yet

Changes to be committed:
  (use "git rm --cached <file>..." to unstage)
	new file:   test.txt

```

Now the file is staged. 

Let's edit it further. 


```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ['skip-execution']
echo "version 2" >> test.txt
```

So the file has two lines

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ['skip-execution']
cat test.txt 
```

```{code-block} console
version 1
version 2
```

Now check status again. 

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ['skip-execution']
git status
```

```{code-block} console
On branch main

No commits yet

Changes to be committed:
  (use "git rm --cached <file>..." to unstage)
	new file:   test.txt

Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git restore <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
	modified:   test.txt

```

We added the first version of the file to the staging area, so that version is ready to commit  but we have changed the version in our working directory relative to the version from the hash object that we put in the staging area so we *also* have changes not staged.



We can hash and store this version too. 

```
git hash-object -w test.txt 
```

```{code-block} console
0c1e7391ca4e59584f8b773ecdbbb9467eba1547
```

and verify a new object was created? 

```
find .git/objects/ -type f
```

```{code-block} console
.git/objects//0c/1e7391ca4e59584f8b773ecdbbb9467eba1547
.git/objects//d6/70460b4b4aece5915caf5c68d12f560a9fe3e4
.git/objects//4b/825dc642cb6eb9a060e54bf8d69288fbee4904
.git/objects//83/baae61804e65cc73a7201a7252750c76066a30
```

visually we now have 4 objects:
- plain content
- 2 versions of the file
- an empty tree

```{mermaid}
classDiagram
    class d67046{
        +"test content"
        +(blob)
    }
    class 83baae{
       +Version 1
       +(blob)
    }
    class 4b825d{
        +(tree)
    }
    class 0c1e73{
        +Version 1
        +Verson 2
        +(blob)
    }
```

Again, let's check in

```
git status
```

```{code-block} console
On branch main

No commits yet

Changes to be committed:
  (use "git rm --cached <file>..." to unstage)
	new file:   test.txt

Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git restore <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
	modified:   test.txt

```

Hashing the content does not change the status here at all, because `git status` only traces from the `HEAD` pointer, compares that commit's tree to the index and the current working directory.  We have no commits still and the index has not changed by hashing the content and creating a blob for it. 

## Writing a tree

Now we can write a tre  and it will have content. 
```
git write-tree
```

```{code-block} console
d8329fc1cc938780ffdd9f94e0d364e0ea74f579
```

Lets examine the tree, first check the type
```
git cat-file -t d832
```

```{code-block} console
tree
```

and now we can look at its contents
```
git cat-file -p d832
```

```{code-block} console
100644 blob 83baae61804e65cc73a7201a7252750c76066a30	test.txt
```

it tells us the mode of the single file is a regular file, that it is a blob, the hash where the file's content is snapshotted and the file name. 


```{mermaid}
classDiagram
    class d67046{
        +"test content"
        +(blob)
    }
    class 83baae{
       +Version 1
       +(blob)
    }
    class 4b825d{
        +(tree)
    }
    class d8329f{
        +blob: 83baae
        +filename: test.txt
        +(tree)
    }
    class 0c1e73{
        +Version 1
        +Verson 2
        +(blob)
    }

    d8329f --|> 83baae
```

This only keeps track of th objects, there are also still the HEAD that we have not dealt with and the index. 

Now two of our objects are linked! the tree points to the blob of the first version of the file.  We are getting closer to what would happend when we make a commit with a porcelain command. 

```
git status
```

```{code-block} console
On branch main

No commits yet

Changes to be committed:
  (use "git rm --cached <file>..." to unstage)
	new file:   test.txt

Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git restore <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
	modified:   test.txt

```



## Creating a commit manually

We can echo a commit message through a pipe into the commit-tree plumbing function to commit a particular hashed object.


```
echo "first commit" | git commit-tree d8329
```

```{code-block} console
0ec6f39c964a3149d426ae45bef4385e14444b2c
```

and we get back a hash. But notice that this hash is unique for each of us. Because the commit has information about the time stamp and our user. 


The above hash is the one I got during class, but if I rerun I will get a different hash even though I have the same name and e-mail because the time changed.

```{important}
You can find the hash of your commit object later by comparing to mine and getting the one that is unique or by checkign the type of all of your objects until you find the one that is a commit. 
```

We can also look at its type

```
git cat-file -t 0ec6
```

```{code-block} console
commit
```

and we can look at the content

```
git cat-file -p 0ec6
```

```{code-block} console
tree d8329fc1cc938780ffdd9f94e0d364e0ea74f579
author Sarah M Brown <brownsarahm@uri.edu> 1697131751 -0400
committer Sarah M Brown <brownsarahm@uri.edu> 1697131751 -0400

first commit
```


Now we check the final status of our repo

```
git status
```

```{code-block} console
On branch main

No commits yet

Changes to be committed:
  (use "git rm --cached <file>..." to unstage)
	new file:   test.txt

Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git restore <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
	modified:   test.txt

```



we see it is "on main" this is because we set the branch to main , but since we have not written there, we have to do it directly. Notice that when we use the porcelain command for commit, it does this automatically; the porcelain commands do many things.



```{important}
Check that you also have 6 objects and 5 of them should match mine, the one you should not have is the `0ec6f` one but you should have a different hash for your commit. 
```

```{mermaid}
classDiagram
    class d67046{
        test content
        (blob)
    }
    class 83baae{
        Version 1
        (blob)
    }
    class 4b825d{
        (tree)
    }
    class d8329f{
        blob: 83baae
        filename: test.txt
        (tree)
    }
    class 0c1e73{
        Version 1
        Verson 2
        (blob)
    }
    class 0ec6f{
        tree d8329f
        author name
        commit time
    }
    d8329f --|> 83baae
    0ec6f --|> d8329f
```


It still says no commits, even though we just verified that it has one. 

## Git references


Remember git status compares the working directory to the current state of the active branch

- we cansee the working directory with: `ls`
- we can see the active branch in the `HEAD` file 
- what is its status? 


Notice, git said we have no commits yet even though we have written a commit. 

In our case because we made the commit manually, we did not update the branch. 

 This is because the main branch does not *point* to any commit.


We can verify by looking at the `HEAD` file
```
cat .git/HEAD
```

```{code-block} console
ref: refs/heads/main
```

and see that: 
```
cat .git/refs/heads/main
```

```{code-block} console
cat: .git/refs/heads/main: No such file or directory
```
which does not even exist!


we can see the objects though: 

```
find .git/objects/ -type f
```

```{code-block} console
.git/objects//0c/1e7391ca4e59584f8b773ecdbbb9467eba1547
.git/objects//0e/c6f39c964a3149d426ae45bef4385e14444b2c
.git/objects//d6/70460b4b4aece5915caf5c68d12f560a9fe3e4
.git/objects//d8/329fc1cc938780ffdd9f94e0d364e0ea74f579
.git/objects//4b/825dc642cb6eb9a060e54bf8d69288fbee4904
.git/objects//83/baae61804e65cc73a7201a7252750c76066a30
```

and we can create that file by putting the full hash of the commit into the file


```
echo 0ec6f39c964a3149d426ae45bef4385e14444b2c > .git/refs/heads/main
```

so that
```
cat .git/refs/heads/main
```

shows the hash:
```{code-block} console
0ec6f39c964a3149d426ae45bef4385e14444b2c
```

Now we check status and we are all set!


```
git status
```

```{code-block} console
On branch main
Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git restore <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
	modified:   test.txt

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
```

## Experience Report Evidence


Put your list of objects in your `test` repo into a file `test_repo_ojbects.txt` in your Experience report branch. 

## Questions After Today's Class 

### Can a pointer to an old file exist as an object in the git objects?

a tree will have a pointer to the previous version of the file yes. 

### Is there a manual way to do other commands like git push and git add?

We did git add today.  We hashed the object and added the hash to the index.  Push does have some other steps in it, those are in the practice badge. 


### Why you are allowed to create empty trees if it is basically a wasted file?

Because it does not hurt anything. 

### How are pipes and redirect different?

Pipes connect stdout to stdin, to connect commands.  Redirect just changes the source. 


### When do people manually create git objects and commits?

Manually exploring is not a common scenario.  These commands *exist* primarily for git itself, remember modular code gives more power.  

We went through doing it manually to see and understand. You can end up in edge case scenarios in other ways, but using the plubming commands is the best way to to see that. 


### Why are these commands so easy to confuse and mix up with each other? I have a hard time remembering some of the longer commands.

Some of the commands we have used are detailed low frequency use commands that you do not need to memorize. 

### Is there a quicker way to find the onbject type if you get lost. Instead of going through each of them with the "git cat-file -t" command?

For this activity, you can copmare to mine.  In a normal use scenario, you would not do this manually, so you would have some other way to know what commit or object you were looking for. 


### what are hashes?

A hash is a fixed length representation of variable lenght input.  We will see more about them in the coming weeks. 

### What are trees?

Trees are one type of git object, that contains information about the directory at a given moment.  It contains pointers to the blob objects andinformation about each file. 


### How do I change my inclass branch from master to main??

```
git branch -m main
```

### What is the difference between the -t and -p flags? I noticed them while going through the comnmands.

these are options on [`git cat-file`](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-cat-file).  They're defined above and at the link. 


### Would there be any reason to use these commands rather than relying on the porcelain commands?

Not if things are going well, but they could be used to try to figure out what went wrong if you find a repo in a weird state. 


### when would we use this over doing it on GitHub itself aside from offline?

We cannot run these detailed steps on github in browser.  Recall, we do not even directly "add" files there.  In browser, we have to commit in order to save a file. 


### Why does the file still have untracked changes? 

We hashed the file, but did not put the second hash into the tree or create a second commiit.
