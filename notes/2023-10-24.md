# How can I use bash to automate things?  


## What is bash again? 



So far we have used bash commands to navigate our file system as a way to learn about the file system itself. To do this we used commands like:
- `mv`
- `cd`
- `pwd`
- `ls` 

Bash is a unix shell for the GNU operating system and it has been adopted in other contexts as well.  It is the default shell on Ubuntu linux as well for example (and many others). This is why we teach it. 


We can describe this relationship with a concept map.  Each shape corresponds to a *concept* and the arrows are labeled to describe the relationship between the two concepts.  This can be a helpful way of writing out how you understand things.  




```{mermaid}
flowchart TD
    shell --> |is accessed through| terminal
    bash --> |is instance of| shell
    zsh --> |is instance of| shell
    git --> |is a program accessed though | shell

```

A Unix shell is both a command interpreter and a programming language. As a command interpreter, the shell provides the user interface to the rich set of GNU utilities. The programming language features allow these utilities to be combined. 


Read the official definition of `bash` and a shell in [the bash manual](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/bash.html#Introduction)

We can add this information to the diagram: 

```{mermaid}
flowchart TD
    shell --> |is accessed through| terminal
    bash --> |is instance of| shell
    zsh --> |is instance of| shell
    git --> |is a program accessed though | shell
    subgraph shell
        pl[programming language]
        i[command interpreter]
    end

```

## What does this definiton of bash mean?

Today we will start from the main course directory.


Note on macOS when I run `bash` to use the bash shell, it reminds me that MacOS prefers a different shell. 

```{code-block} console
    Last login: Sat Oct 21 17:29:01 on ttys080

The default interactive shell is now zsh.
To update your account to use zsh, please run `chsh -s /bin/zsh`.
For more details, please visit https://support.apple.com/kb/HT208050.
```


We can have different shells in the same terminal in some cases, and all of the different shells on the system have access to the same file system.  



Then I will move to my systems dir
```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
cd Documents/inclass/systems/
```


and look at files

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
ls
```

```{code-block} console
fa23-kwl-brownsarahm		github-inclass-fa23-brownsarahm
fall2023			test
ghic				tiny-book
```

## Working from an Example 

```{important}
Here I used `cd fa23-kwl-brownsarahm` and `gh repo view --web` to go to my KWL repo in the browser and then `cd ..` to go back
```

In your KWL repo the `.github/workflows` directory has several `.yml` files that are github action files.  

These files are yaml, with key:value pairs. The values of the `run` key are commands that are passed to bash.  So these are a place where you can see examples of what I did to look for particular syntax.  


Learning from examples is a common strategy in CS and how you can learn new technology especially in a job, so today in class, we modeled that by looking for different syntax in the action files and building up what those things do.  

````{margin}
```{note}
Adding more about github actions here is a good community badge opp. 

Also the note about GNU. 
```
````


## Variables in Bash


We can create variables like `VARNAME=value`. 

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
NAME='Sarah'
```


notice that there are **no spaces** around the `=`. spaces in bash separate commands and options, so they cannot be in variable declarations.  



A common mistake is to put a space around the `=` sign, this is actually considered **good style** in many other languages. 

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
NAME ='Sarah'
```

```{code-block} console
-bash: NAME: command not found
```
In bash, however, this creates an error.  When there is a space after `NAME`, `bash` tried to interpet `NAME` as a bash command, but then it does not find it, so it gives an error. 

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
NAME='Sarah'
```


We can use variables  with a `$` before the variable name. 

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
echo $NAME
```

```{code-block} console
Sarah
```

```{important}

This variable is local, in memory, to the current terminal window, so if we open a separate window and try `echo $NAME` it will not work. We can also see that it does not create any file changes. 
```

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
echo $NAME
```

```{code-block} console
Sarah
```

We can see that it does not create any files by comparing ls now to what it was before: 
```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
ls
```

```{code-block} console
fa23-kwl-brownsarahm		github-inclass-fa23-brownsarahm
fall2023			test
ghic				tiny-book
```


```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
ls -a
```

```{code-block} console
.				ghic
..				github-inclass-fa23-brownsarahm
fa23-kwl-brownsarahm		test
fall2023			tiny-book
```

We can, however use the variable at different working directories. So if we move

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
cd github-inclass-fa23-brownsarahm/
```

and `echo` agian


```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
echo $NAME
```

```{code-block} console
Sarah
```
it still works!


The `$` is essential syntax for recalling variables in bash. If we forget it, it treats it as a literal
```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
echo NAME
```

```{code-block} console
NAME
```

so we get the variable **name** out instead of the variable **value**

We'll go back up a level now: 

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
cd ..
```
<!-- 
```{code-block} console
``` 
-->


## Bash Loops

We can also make loops like

```
for loopvar in list
do
# loop body
echo $loopvar
done
```

So for example we can loop over some names
````{margin}
```{important}
If you copy-paste this it will have an error, the `>` will appear if you type this content in as a part of the prompt, butyou cannot copy them. 
```
````

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
for name in Sarah Amoy Marcin 
> do
> echo $name
> done
```

A few important things, to make note of:
- loop variable does not need to be an iterator.  the loop variable here `name` takes each value from a list (`Sarah Amoy Marcin`)
- lists is bash are defined with no brackets and no commas `Sarah Amoy Marcin` is a list
- we start the loop body with `do` and close it with `done` these are like the `{` and `}` in some langauges. 
- after we start the loop with a line starting with `for` bash continues that "command" by putting `>` at the start of each line until we end the loop with `done` and then it runs. 


And we see it echos each name: 

```{code-block} console
Sarah
Amoy
Marcin
```

Note that the loop variable is not scope limited to the loop.  After the loop it still has the same value of the last time through the loop. 


```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
echo $name
```

```{code-block} console
Marcin
```

When we get the command back with the up arrow key, it puts it all on one line, because it was one command.  The `;` (semicolon) separates the "lines"

We can add another name in 

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
for name in Sarah Amoy Marcin Osman; do echo $name; done
```


```{code-block} console
Sarah
Amoy
Marcin
Osman
```
the output is like before, but with one more


```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
echo $name
```

```{code-block} console
Osman
```

and this time `Osman` is the name left in the loop variable later. 


## Nesting commands

There are examples of this in your KWL repo actions.  If we want the output of a command to be in a variable this is how to do it. 


To do this, let's move to a folder with some files in it. 

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
cd github-inclass-fa23-brownsarahm/
```

here we have a number of files in this working directory: 

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
ls
```

```{code-block} console
API.md			abstract_base_class.py	important_classes.py
CONTRIBUTING.md		alternative_classes.py	setup.py
LICENSE.md		docs			tests
README.md		helper_functions.py
```

We can run a command to generate the list by putting it inside `$()` to run that command first.  Think kind of like PEMDAS and the `$` in bash is for variables. 

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
for FILE in $(ls)
> do
> echo $FILE
> done
```

```{code-block} console
API.md
CONTRIBUTING.md
LICENSE.md
README.md
abstract_base_class.py
alternative_classes.py
docs
helper_functions.py
important_classes.py
setup.py
tests
```
the `$()` tells bash to run that command first and then hold its output as a variable for use elsewhere

For example, in your `getassignment.yml` I have a line like this: 

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
pretitle="prepare-"$(sysgetbadgedate --prepare)
```

it creates a variable that is "prepare-" concatenated with the output of `sysgetbadgedate --prepare`

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
echo $pretitle 
```

```{code-block} console
prepare-2023-10-26
```

We can also modify our previous loop with an option: 

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
for FILE in $(ls -a); do echo $FILE; done
```

```{code-block} console
.
..
.git
.github
API.md
CONTRIBUTING.md
LICENSE.md
README.md
abstract_base_class.py
alternative_classes.py
docs
helper_functions.py
important_classes.py
setup.py
tests
```


## Conditionals in bash

We can also do conditional statements
```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
if test -f docs 
> then
> echo "file"
> fi
```
the key parts of this: 
- `test` checks if a file or directory exists
- the `-f` option makes it check if the item is a *file*
- what to do if the condition is met goes after a `then` keyword
- the `fi` (backwards`if`) closes the if statment
- the `>` work again like the loop and the `\` we did in the past


this if does nothing though, because `docs` is a directory not a file. 


If we switch it, we get output: 
```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
if test -f API.md ; then echo "file"; fi
```

```{code-block} console
file
```

## Script files 

We can put our script into a file 
```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
nano filecheck.sh
```

and check the content of the file

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
cat filecheck.sh 
```

```{code-block} console
for file in $(ls)
do
	if test -f $file
	then
		echo $file
	fi
done
```

and run it with `bash <filename>`

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
bash filecheck.sh 
```

```{code-block} console
API.md
CONTRIBUTING.md
LICENSE.md
README.md
abstract_base_class.py
alternative_classes.py
filecheck.sh
helper_functions.py
important_classes.py
setup.py
```

And this is as `ls` except without the folders:

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
ls
```

```{code-block} console
API.md			abstract_base_class.py	helper_functions.py
CONTRIBUTING.md		alternative_classes.py	important_classes.py
LICENSE.md		docs			setup.py
README.md		filecheck.sh		tests
```

```{important}
We also looked at the structure and some examples of the action files in the KWL repo and course website. 

I recommend the docs, starting from the [quickstart](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/quickstart) and the [understand section](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/understanding-github-actions)
```

## Terminal coloring and customizing your prompt. 

Your path settings, aliases, and the your prompt can be set with a file.  

On MacOS the file is called `.bash_profile` and is stored at your `~` home directory.  If you use `zsh` instead of bash there is a different file, but it is similar. 

On linux it is `.bashrc` it should be the same in WSL on Windows.  

```{admonition} Community Badge opportunity
If you use windows, can you PR to update these notes with what file is used and which terminal/shell you are using (bash via GitBash, powershell, bash in WSL, etc. )
```

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
cat ~/.bash_profile
```


I have some aliases set, this way when I use Python, I can use the `python` command instead of `python3`. 

the `PS1` variable describes the main default prompt, according to [the spec](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Controlling-the-Prompt.html). [this tool can help you customize your prompt](https://bash-prompt-generator.org/)

```{code-block} console
alias pip=pip3
alias python=python3

export PS1="\u@\W $ "

# >>> conda initialize >>>
# !! Contents within this block are managed by 'conda init' !!
__conda_setup="$('/Users/brownsarahm/anaconda3/bin/conda' 'shell.bash' 'hook' 2> /dev/null)"
if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then
    eval "$__conda_setup"
else
    if [ -f "/Users/brownsarahm/anaconda3/etc/profile.d/conda.sh" ]; then
        . "/Users/brownsarahm/anaconda3/etc/profile.d/conda.sh"
    else
        export PATH="/Users/brownsarahm/anaconda3/bin:$PATH"
    fi
fi
unset __conda_setup
# <<< conda initialize <<<

## Experience Report Evidence

## Questions After Today's Class 

### How often will we be writing scripts for this class?

Just a few times to get practice and exposure, but they will come back in 412 and are handy in general. 

### Are bash scripts commonly used today in real world applications or is it something that was used more in the 70s?

They are still super common.  GitHub actions can be written using bash scripting as a strategy.  Lots of systems have build scripts.   

The thing we would not do that often that we did today was write it from nano instead of a full IDE. 

### What is the scope of loop variables?

In bash the loop variable has the same scope as any other variable.  It is the same in Python.  This is one of the many features that can very from language to language. 

### When would I use bash instead of a different programming language?

When you need to do things that are file operations or other os level actions, it can be faster to run if it is in bash.  

### What specific tasks do developers like to use bash to automate?

build processes, file manipulations, git operations.  Anything even just a few steps that would be repetitive and you would have to do often.  

### do people write full programs in bash using things like nano or directly into the terminal?

Yes! Some people especialy people who started programming a long time ago still do.  

More often, using a terminal text editor is a handy tool to use on occasion, but not for every day work. We will work on a remote server, which is an occasion you would use that, on Thursday. 

### Is there a way to save files that you create in the shell?

yes, today we saved the filecheck.sh file. 

### what else can we do with bash?

Its mostly for automating things and processing files or outputs.  

It *can* do anything though. 

### Does running a bash script with `bash <filename>`` remove the need to add #!/bin/bash to the top of it and then make it executable prior to running? 

Yes. by running it like `bash <filename` it works just like passing those lines in the file to bash. 

Alternatively you can put the shebang `#!/bin/bash` at the top to tell the computer what shell to use to run it and then treat it as an executable. 

We will learn about making it executable permissions wise on Thursday. 


### Is it possible to create functions in bash scripts?

Yes! [see the GNU bash docs on functions](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Shell-Functions.html)


### Where would we see bash the most as a developer? Would we use this language more for an embedded swe role or is it something that's present in every type of programming job.

I think it's present in just about any programming job.  You will always need to work with files at times, you will alwasy have repetitive things that you do not want to do manually.  You may write more or less, but it's alwasy a handy tool to have. 

### Where could I learn more about writing something similar to the workflows we saw?

The [github actions documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/actions) has instructions with how tos, API like documentation, and examples.
