**integrative 2**: The PR title must be `review-2023-10-26` verbatim to get the double credit

create a `vocab-quiz.md` file with 10 mutliple choice questions that cover topics from at least 5 different class sessions. Each question should have 4 options, 1 correct and 3 that represent a reasonable, but incorrect idea someone may have. Questions should check that a person understand the key terms of the first half of the course. For each option explain why it is/not correct in a way that would help clarify someone's confusion if they had picked that answer instead of the correct answer.
