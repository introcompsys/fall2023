3. Create some variations of the `hello.c` we made in class. Make {index}`hello2.c` print twice with 2 print commands. Make {index}`hello5.c` print 5 times with a for loop and {index}`hello7.c` print 7 times with a for loop. Build them all on the command line and make sure they run correctly. 
4. Write a bash script, {index}`assembly.sh` to compile each program to assembly and print the number of lines in each file.  
5. Put the output of your script in {index}`hello_assembly_compare.md`. Add to the file some notes on how they are similar or different based on your own reading of them.
