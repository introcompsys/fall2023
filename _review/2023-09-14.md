Any steps in a badge marked **lab** are steps that we are going to focus in on during lab time.  Remember the goal of lab is to help you complete the work, not add additional work. The lab checkout will include some other tasks and then we will encourage you to work on this badge while we are there to help. Lab checkouts are checked only for completion though, not correctness, so steps of activities that we want you to really think about and revise if incorrect will be in a practice or review badge. 

1. Read the notes. If you have any questions, post an issue on the course website repo. 
2. Using your terminal, download your KWL repo. Include the command used in your badge PR. 
3. Try using setting up git using your favorite IDE or GitHub Desktop. Make a file {index}`gitoffline.md` and include some notes of how it went. Was it hard? easy? what did you figure out or get stuck on? Is the terminology consistent or does it use different terms?
4. **lab** Explore the difference between git add and git commit: try committing and pushing without adding, then add and push without committing. Describe what happens in each case in a file called {index}`gitcommit.md`. Compare what happens based on what you can see on GitHub and what you can see with git status.
