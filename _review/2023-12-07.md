1. Choose two languges with different standings in the [desired admired list](https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2023/#technology-admired-and-desired).  THis could be a highly admired and least desired; it could be one with a small gap and one with a large gap. Read a few posts about each language and try to figure out why it is/not admired or desired. Summarize your findings.  Include links to all of the posts you read in a section titled `## Sources` in your markdown file. For each source, make a bulleted list with some notes about the author's background and any limitations that might put on the scope of their opinions. (for example, a data scientists's opinion on languages is very valuable for data science, but less for app development) Add this to your kwl repo in `language_love_dread.md`.
