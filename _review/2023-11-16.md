1. While we saw many types of gates today, but we actually could get all of the operations needed using only NAND gates. Work out how to use NAND gates to implement `and` and `or` in {index}`nandandor.md`
2. Add {index}`bitwise.md` to your kwl and write the bitwise operations required for the following transformations (replace the `(_)` with a bitwise operator (`&, |, ^, >>, <<`)):
    ```
    4 (_) 128
    12493 (_) -12494
    127 (_) 15
    7 (_) 56
    4 (_) -5
    45 (_) 37 = 37
    45 (_) 37 = 45
    3 (_) 5 = 7
    6 (_) 8 = 0
    10 (_) 5 = 15
    ```
