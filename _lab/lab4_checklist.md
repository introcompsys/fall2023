# Work and Self Reflection

## Work on what you need

Work on whatever badges feel most essential to you right now.  

Look for ones that you are less certain and discuss with classmates, the TAs, and Dr. Brown how to complete those tasks. 


## Self Reflection 

Either locally or in a codespace, use `gh pr list` from the GitHub CLI to view your progress in the course. Use the [docs](https://cli.github.com/manual/gh_pr_list) for this command to be able to see all of your badge statuses. You may also find it helpful to use `gh issue list` to view what you have open. 

On the branch for this issue, create `lab4.md` and answer the following questions:

```
- How many badges are complete and approved?
- How many are awaiting revision?
- How many are awaiting review?
- Are your PRs titles such that it would be easy to calculate your grade with a script?
```

*if the answer to the last question is no, it is a good time to fix them*
