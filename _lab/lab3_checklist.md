# Organize Files

## Plan for success

I want you to plan out what things you are going to do and to confirm that your planned work matches the grade you expect

1. Create a a dedicated branch for this task, named `grade_plan`
2. Fill in the `about.md` file in your KWL repo so I can know a little more about you. You can add extra sections or whatever you think will help me support you. 
3. Answer the following in a a file called `plan.md`. 

```
# Plan for success

__Target Grade:__ 

## Plan to get there: 
- x experience badges 
- x lab checkouts
- (other badges you plan)

<!-- If you plan any build badges,uncomment the line below and list some ideas, topics from the course website your are curious about or questions you have. Also think about what timeline you could realistically achieve them on. This is nonbinding, but to start the conversation  -->
<!--## Builds -->

<!-- If you plan any explore badges, create a schedule and propose one topic for your first explore badge -->

<!--## Explore -->
```

Request a review from @brownsarahm on this plan. I will give you feedback/help you start planning out your work as appropriate. If you need time to think about this before you want feedback, open the PR, but do not request the review yet.  

## Learn a little about CodeSpaces

[Codespaces](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/overview) are a virutal machine that you can use VSCode on in browser.  You only have VSCode access to this system, but VSCode with the terminal is a lot of power. 

If VSCode is new to you, use their documentation of the [VSCode interface](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/userinterface) to get oriented to the different parts of the screen. 

On a branch for this issue, create a file `lab3.md` and write a note to your future self describing what a codespace is. 

## Moving Files practice 

 

1. [accept this assignment to get a messy repo](https://classroom.github.com/a/kNCZE42i)
2. work in a Codespace, by clicking the Codespace link in the README file of the repo created or using the Codespace tab on the Code menu (click the green Code button).
3. Optionally, set a [theme](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/themes)
4. Follow the instructions in the README file. 
5. When you are done cleaning, use the terminal to commit and push your changes. 
6. In the terminal, write the history to a file called `cleanuplog.txt` using a redirect and the `history` command. 
7. Use the VSCode version control menu in the Codespace to commit and push these files. 


**note that if you skip a commit message, it still opens a file for you to edit, but since you are in VSCode, it is as a file instead of with vim**

## Badge Work

1. Read the practice and review badges for yesterday's class. 
2. Decide which you will do
3. Start the badge by creating a branch for it and opening that branch in a codespace.
4. Create the file 
5. work more if time
6. Commit and push
   
You'll have to finish the badge working locally because CodeSpaces only allow you to work with one repo at a time by default. 


## Lab Checkout 

1. Make a PR for the branch linked to this PR. 
2. Use the checklist in the PR
3. meet with a TA or Instructor

```
- [ ] lab3.md file exists in the PR
- [ ] plan PR exists
- [ ] messy repo work is committed
- [ ] history file from messy repo

```
