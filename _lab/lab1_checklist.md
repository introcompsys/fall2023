# Setup

## Lab Intro

In lab each week, you will work at your own pace with the TAs and I around to help you.  Each week, at or right before the start of lab, I will post an issue on your repo with the lab activity. 

For all of these steps, you can discuss with neighbors, but everyone must submit their own work. 

## Setup 

*each of the links in the following steps are to the documentation for how to do the step*

- [ ] Merge the PR with template updates
- [ ] [Create a project](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/planning-and-tracking-with-projects/creating-projects/creating-a-project#creating-an-organization-project) for grade tracking
- [ ] set the [visibility](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/planning-and-tracking-with-projects/managing-your-project/managing-visibility-of-your-projects#changing-project-visibility) so that it is private
- [ ] [link the project to your repo]([project](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/planning-and-tracking-with-projects/managing-your-project/adding-your-project-to-a-repository))
- [ ] make sure your experience report from yesterday is set up
- [ ] make sure you have git installed locally (instructions in tools section of syllabus)


## Syllabus Quiz

Complete this [syllabus quiz](https://forms.gle/vJHyGJpGcLcNYL6K7). 

You should definitely use the syllabus and you may talk with neighbors, but be sure to understand everything. 


## Find your terminal

On Mac you should use your native terminal app, but optionally switch to bash from zsh.  zsh will be the same in most cases, but occasionally different. 

On Windows you should use GitBash (git for windows). 

## Lab Reflection

1. Create a [branch for this issue](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/planning-and-tracking-with-projects/managing-your-project/managing-visibility-of-your-projects#changing-project-visibility) **keep the default name**
2. Create a file `lab1.md` on the new branch 
3. Copy and fill in the template below to the `lab1.md` file

```
