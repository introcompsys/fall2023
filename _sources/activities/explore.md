# Explore Badges


```{warning}
Explore Badges are not required, but an option for higher grades. The logistics of this could be streamlined or the instructions may become more detialed during the penalty free zone. 
```


Explore Badges can take different forms so the sections below outline some options. This page is not a cumulative list of requirements or an exhaustive list of options.


```{tip}
You might get a lot of suggestions for improvement on your first one, but if you apply that advice to future ones, they will get approved faster. 
```

## How do I propose?

Create an issue on your kwl repo, label it explore, and "assign" @brownsarahm. 

In your issue, describe the question you want to answer or topic to explore and the format you want to use. 

If you propose something too big, you might be advised to consider a build badge instead.  If you propose something too small, you will get ideas as options for how to expand it and you pick which ones. 

## Where to put the work?

- If you extend a more practice exercise, you can add to the markdown file that the exercise instructs you to create.
- If its a question of your own, add a new file to your KWL repo.

```{important}
Either way, there must be a separate issue for this work that is also linked to your PR
```



## What should the work look like?

It should look like a blog post, written tutorial, graphic novel, or visual aid with caption.  It will likely contain some code excerpts the way the class notes do. Style-wise it can be casual, like how you may talk through a concept with a friend or a more formal, academic tone.  What is important is that it clearly demonstrates that you understand the material.

The exact length can vary, but these must go beyond what we do in class in scope 

## Explore Badge Ideas:

- Extend a more practice:
    - for a more practice that asks you to describe potential uses for a tool, try it out, find or write code excerpts and examine them 
    - for a more practice that asks you to try something, try some other options and compare and contrast them. eg "try git in your favorite IDE" -> "try git in three different IDEs, compare and contrast, and make recommendations for novice developers"
- For a topic that left you still a little confused or their was one part that you wanted to know more about. Details your journey from confusion or shallow understanding to a full understanding. This file would include the sources that you used to gather a deeper understanding. eg: 
    - Describe how cryptography evolved and what caused it to evolve (i.e. SHA-1 being decrypted)
    - Learn a lot more about a specific number system 
    - compare another git host
    - try a different type of version control
- Create a visual aid/memory aid to help remember a topic. Draw inspriation from [Wizard Zines](https://wizardzines.com/) 
- Review a reference or resource for a topic
- write a code tour that orients a new contributor to a past project or an open source tool you like. 

Examples from past students:

```{note}
These students technically submitted these under different grading structures, but were approximately the same as the explore badges
```

- Scripts/story boards for tiktoks that break down course topics 
- Visual aid drawings to help remember key facts
