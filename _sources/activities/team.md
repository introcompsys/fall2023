# Team Repo

(groupcontrib)=
## Contributions

Your team repo is a place to build up a glossary of key terms and a "cookbook" of "recipes" of common things you might want to do on the shell, bash commands, git commands and others.  

For the glossary, follow the [jupyterbook](https://jupyterbook.org/en/stable/reference/cheatsheet.html#) syntax.  

For the cookbook, use standard markdown.

To nest blocks use increasing numbers of back ticks.

To make a link, `[show the text in squarebrackets](url/in/parenthesis)`

## Collaboration

You will be in a "team" that is your built in collaboration group to practice using Git Collaboratively.  
There will be assignments that are to be completed in that repo as well.  These activities will be marked accordingly.  You will take turns and each of you is required to do the initialization step on a recurring basis.  

This is also where you can ask questions and draft definitions to things.

## Peer Review  


If there are minor errors/typos, suggest corrections inline.

In your summary comments answer the following:
- Is the contribution clear and concise? Identify any aspect of the writing that tripped you up as a reader.
- Are the statements in the contribution verifiable (either testable or cited source)? If so, how do you know they are correct?
- Does the contribution offer complete information? That is, does it rely on specific outside knowledge or could another CS student not taking our class understand it?
- Identify one strength in the contribution, and identify one aspect that could be strengthened further.

Choose an action:
- If the suggestions necessary before merging, select **request changes**.  
- If it is good enough to merge, mark it **approved** and open a new issue for the broader suggestions.
- If you are unsure, post as a **comment** and invite other group members to join the discussion.
