# Prepare for the next class




These tasks are not always based on things that we have already done.  Sometimes they are to have you start thinking about the topic that we are *about* to cover. Getting whatever you know about the topic fresh in your mind in advance of class will help what we do in class stick for you when we start.

The correct answer is not as important for these activities as it is to do them before class.  We will build on these in class. These are evaluated on completion only, but we may ask you questions or leave comments if appropriate, in that event you should reply and then we'll approve.
