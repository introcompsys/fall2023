# General URI Policies


## Anti-Bias  Statement:

We respect the rights and dignity of each individual and group. We reject prejudice and intolerance, and we work to understand differences. We believe that equity and inclusion are critical components for campus community members to thrive. If you are a target or a witness of a bias incident, you are encouraged to submit a report to the URI Bias Response Team at www.uri.edu/brt. There you will also find people and resources to help.



## Disability Services for Students Statement:

Your access in this course is important. Please send me your Disability Services for Students (DSS) accommodation letter early in the semester so that we have adequate time to discuss and arrange your approved academic accommodations. If you have not yet established services through DSS, please contact them to engage in a confidential conversation about the process for requesting reasonable accommodations in the classroom. DSS can be reached by calling: 401-874-2098, visiting: web.uri.edu/disability, or emailing: dss@etal.uri.edu.  We are available to meet with students enrolled in Kingston as well as Providence courses.





## Academic Honesty

Students are expected to be honest in all academic work. A student’s name on any written work, quiz or exam shall be regarded as assurance that the work is the result of the student’s own independent thought and study. Work should be stated in the student’s own words, properly attributed to its source.   Students have an obligation to know how to quote, paraphrase, summarize, cite and reference the work of others with integrity. The following are examples of academic dishonesty.



- Using material, directly or paraphrasing, from published sources (print or electronic) without appropriate citation
- Claiming disproportionate credit for work not done independently
- Unauthorized possession or access to exams
- Unauthorized communication during exams
- Unauthorized use of another’s work or preparing work for another student
- Taking an exam for another student
- Altering or attempting to alter grades
- The use of notes or electronic devices to gain an unauthorized advantage during exams
- Fabricating or falsifying facts, data or references
- Facilitating or aiding another’s academic dishonesty
- Submitting the same paper for more than one course without prior approval from the instructors


## URI COVID-19 Statement

The University is committed to delivering its educational mission while protecting the health and safety of our community. While the university has worked to create a healthy learning environment for all, it is up to all of us to ensure our campus stays that way.

As members of the URI community, students are required to comply with standards of conduct and take precautions to keep themselves and others safe. Visit [web.uri.edu/coronavirus/](https://web.uri.edu/coronavirus/) for the latest information about the URI COVID-19 response.

- [Universal indoor masking](https://web.uri.edu/coronavirus/2021/08/12/university-to-follow-indoor-universal-masking-on-campus/) is required by all community members, on all campuses, regardless of vaccination status. If the universal mask mandate is discontinued during the semester, students who have an approved exemption and are not fully vaccinated will need to continue to wear a mask indoors and maintain physical distance.  
- Students who are experiencing symptoms of illness should not come to class.  Please stay in your home/room and notify URI Health Services via phone at 401-874-2246.
- If you are already on campus and start to feel ill, go home/back to your room and self-isolate. Notify URI Health Services via phone immediately at 401-874-2246.


If you are unable to attend class, please notify me at brownsarahm@uri.edu. We will work together to ensure that you are able to successfully complete the course.
