# General URI Policies


## Anti-Bias  Statement:

We respect the rights and dignity of each individual and group. We reject prejudice and intolerance, and we work to understand differences. We believe that equity and inclusion are critical components for campus community members to thrive. If you are a target or a witness of a bias incident, you are encouraged to submit a report to the URI Bias Response Team at www.uri.edu/brt. There you will also find people and resources to help.



## Disability, Access, and Inclusion Services for Students Statement

 Your access in this course is important. Please send me your Disability, Access, and Inclusion (DAI) accommodation letter early in the semester so that we have adequate time to discuss and arrange your approved academic accommodations. If you have not yet established services through DAI, please contact them to engage in a confidential conversation about the process for requesting reasonable accommodations in the classroom. DAI can be reached by calling: 401-874-2098, visiting: [web.uri.edu/disability](http://web.uri.edu/disability), or emailing: dai@etal.uri.edu.  We are available to meet with students enrolled in Kingston as well as Providence courses.


## Academic Honesty

Students are expected to be honest in all academic work. A student’s name on any written work, quiz or exam shall be regarded as assurance that the work is the result of the student’s own independent thought and study. Work should be stated in the student’s own words, properly attributed to its source.   Students have an obligation to know how to quote, paraphrase, summarize, cite and reference the work of others with integrity. The following are examples of academic dishonesty.



- Using material, directly or paraphrasing, from published sources (print or electronic) without appropriate citation
- Claiming disproportionate credit for work not done independently
- Unauthorized possession or access to exams
- Unauthorized communication during exams
- Unauthorized use of another’s work or preparing work for another student
- Taking an exam for another student
- Altering or attempting to alter grades
- The use of notes or electronic devices to gain an unauthorized advantage during exams
- Fabricating or falsifying facts, data or references
- Facilitating or aiding another’s academic dishonesty
- Submitting the same paper for more than one course without prior approval from the instructors

### Viral Illness Precautions

The University is committed to delivering its educational mission while protecting the health and safety of our community. Students who are experiencing symptoms of viral illness should NOT go to class/work. Those who test positive for COVID-19 should follow the isolation guidelines from the Rhode Island Department of Health and CDC.

If you miss class, you do not need to notify me in advance.  You can follow the makeup procedures 

### Excused Absences

Absences due to serious illness or traumatic loss, religious observances, or participation in a university sanctioned event are considered excused absences. For this, contact Dr. Brown when you are ready to get caught up and she will help you make a plan for the best order to complete missed work so that you are able to participate in subsequent activities. Extensions on badges will be provided if needed. 

### Mental Health and Wellness:
