# Badge Deadlines and Procedures

This page includes more visual versions of the information on the badge page.  You should read both, but this one is often more helpful, because some of the processes take a lot of words to explain and make more sense with a diagram for a lot of people.

## Prepare work and Experience Badges Process

```{warning}
This was changed substantively on 2023-09-08
```

This is for a single example with specific dates, but it is similar for all future dates

The columns (and purple boxes) correspond to branches in your KWL repo and the yellow boxes are the things that you have to do. The "critical" box is what you have to wait for us on. The arrows represent PRs (or a local merge for the first one)


```{mermaid}
sequenceDiagram
    participant P as prepare Sep 12
    participant E as experience Sep 12
    participant M as main 
    note over P: complete prepare work<br/> between feb Sep 7 and Sep12
    note over E: run experience badge workflow <br/> at the end of class Sep12
    P ->> E: local merge or PR you that <br/> does not need approval
    note over E: fill in experience reflection 
    critical Badge review by instructor or TA
        E ->> M: Experience badge PR
    option if edits requested
        note over E: make requested edits
    option when approved 
        note over M: merge badge PR
    end
```

In the end the commit sequence for this will look like the following:


```{mermaid}
gitGraph
   commit
   commit
   checkout main
   branch prepare-2023-09-12
   checkout prepare-2023-09-12
   commit id: "gitunderstanding.md"
   branch experience-2023-09-12
   checkout experience-2023-09-12
   commit id: "initexp"
   merge prepare-2023-09-12
   commit id: "fillinexp"
   commit id: "revisions" tag:"approved"
   checkout main
   merge experience-2023-09-12
```

Where the "approved" tag represents and approving reivew on the PR.

## Community Badges

These are the instructions from your `community_contributions.md` file: 
For each one: 
- In the community_contributions.md file on your kwl repo, add an item in a bulleted list (start the line with - )
- Include a link to your contribution like `[text to display](url/of/contribution)`
- create an individual pull request titled "Community-shortname" where `shortname` is a short name for what you did. approval on this PR by Dr. Brown will constitute credit for your grade
- request a review on that PR from @brownsarahm

```{important}
You want one contribution per PR for tracking
```
