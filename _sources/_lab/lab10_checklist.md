# Work time, Prepare, and more Explore Badge Ideas

Today's lab is a couple of admin items and then time to work on 
either a posted badge from this week or a related explore badge.  

## Progress report

Generate a progress report for yourself, either using your functional action that you worked on in lab before, or create an issue titled `Progress report request` by 2:15pm. 

**I'll run a script that checks for issued with that title exactly, case sensitive at 2:15 and comment with a progress report**

Once you have your progress report issue, comment on it and @ mention `brownsarahm` with your answer to the following: 
- does everything look right?
- is there anything you are waiting on?
- what support do you need

## Prepare for class next week

## Bonus explore idea

For the C experiment in 2023-11-07 practice badge, the goal for you to learn here is to see a practical example of how to modify code for use on a server. You can extend this to do something else with the server.  For example: 
- compare the time the experiment takes on your laptop compared to seawulf
- compare timing using a cloud service
- Is the performance different if you put the loop in the C code vs in the bash script? 
- Is there any performance difference in compiling on the login node before vs compiling in the compute node?
- Do other style things you could think of impact the performance?

tip see the man file for the bash command `time`


## Lab checkout 

Create `lab10.md` on a branch linked to this issue and answer the following 

```
1. What progress did you make today? 
1. How well are you utilizing the support systems in this course (office hours, lab time, questions on issues)?
```

Create a PR with the following checklist to go over with a TA or me:

```
- [ ] can run hardware simulator
- [ ] commented on progress report
- [ ] has one new badge officially started (PR open, even if not complete)
```
