# Get organized

## Lab Intro

In lab each week, you will work at your own pace with the TAs and I around to help you.  Each week, at or right before the start of lab, I will post an issue on your repo with the lab activity. 

For all of these steps, you can discuss with neighbors, but everyone must submit their own work. 

## Prepare to get credit for the lab

1. Clone your KWL repo locally, make sure it is **not inside** of your `github-inclass-` repo but in the same folder as that.  As in if you do `ls` you would see both repos. 
2. Create a branch for this issue
3. Check the branch out locally
4. Create a file called `lab2.md`


## Getting Organized 

1. Make sure that the [base role](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/planning-and-tracking-with-projects/managing-your-project/managing-access-to-your-projects#managing-access-for-everyone-in-your-organization) of your project board is "no access"
2. [Bulk add](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/planning-and-tracking-with-projects/managing-items-in-your-project/adding-items-to-your-project#bulk-adding-issues-and-pull-requests) your current **issues** to your project board
3. Customize what feilds are visible and look at the options for automation to make your project board helpful to you
4. Set up [automatic adding](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/planning-and-tracking-with-projects/automating-your-project/adding-items-automatically#about-automatically-adding-items) for issues using the labels
5. Make sure you can find it easily, however works best for you
6. Add a section `# Organization` and make notes about how you set up your board in your `lab2.md` file


## Manage what issues you get 

You can only earn review **or** practice badge for each  date, so if both are there, you should expect to do one and close the other as "not planned". Alternatively you can edit the  action I use to post them so that only one is created.

**this is your choice**

To only get one
1. Navigate to you your `.github/workflows/getassignment.yml` file in your kwl repo
2. click the pencil to edit
3. use the comments to identify the lines related to the badge type you do not want issues for 
4. comment them out with a `#` or delete them
5. commit the changes to a branch and request a review from @instructors


**either way:** add a section `## issues` to your `lab2.md` and state what your plan is.
