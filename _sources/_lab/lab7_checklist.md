# Progress and Work

This week is a checkin and time to work with TA help

## Original Grade Plan

1. Check if your Grade Plan PR is approved or not.  
2. If it's approved, merge it. If not reply to comments


## Badge Check

1. Use [courseutils](https://github.com/introcompsys/courseutils) to verify what has been approved. The README says how to use it. 
1. If the result from default usage does not make sense, use `--help` to learn how to save a more detailed report to a file. 
1. If you plan on build/explore badges, do you have any that Dr. Brown has labeled `proceed`? 

## Logistical Fixes 

Do the following if they apply: 
- merge any approved PRs
- Request a review on PRs that have not been reviewed
- Rename any badge PRs that do not work for tracking
- Work to undo any review or practice badges that were done directly to main
- If you have any accidentally merged experience badges request a reivew from @brownsarahm
- Assign @brownsarahm on any build/explore proposals that you have that need approval


## Progress Reflection


On the branch for this issue, create `lab7.md` and answer the following:

```
- Include the output from  `sysapprovedbadges` (or the file generated as an additional file)
- What cleanup if any did you do?  
- Do you feel like you are on track to earn a grade you will be happy with? If not, what support will you need to get there?  
- Is there anything about course logisitics that you still do not understand? 

```

## Optional Grade Plan revision

If your grade plan is approved and you want to update it, update it on a new branch and create a specific PR for it and request a review from @brownsarahm
