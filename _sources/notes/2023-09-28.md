# How do programmers communicate about code? 

Today we are going to pick up from where we left off talking about the conventional commits. 

That is a core example of the types of detailed communication we do in programming that is embedded into the work. 

## Closing your Codespace

Use the [codespace page](https://github.com/codespaces) to see all of yours. 

Check that your github-inclass repo has no ucnommited changes.  If it does you need to commit them, there are two strategies: 
- start the codespace, commit and push
- from that page, export the changes to a branch, create a PR and merge it if needed

## Build and Explore Ideas 


I am going to put ideas in the [discussions repo](https://github.com/introcompsys/discussion-fa23-community)

I violated the instructions a little, but I thought it made the most sense. 



## Why Documentation

Today we will talk about documentation, there are several reasons this is important: 
- **using** official documentation is the best way to get better at the tools
- understanding how documentation is designed and built will help you use it better
- **writing** and  **maintaining** documentation is really important part of working on a team
- documentation building tools are a type of developer tool (and these are generally good software design)
  


Design is best learned from examples. Some of the best examples of software *design* come from developer tools. 

- [source (js version)](https://third-bit.com/sdxjs/)
- [source (python version)](https://third-bit.com/sdxpy/)



In particular documentation tools are really good examples of: 
- pattern matching
- modularity
- automation
- building 



By the end of today's class you will be able to:
- describe different types of documentation
- find different information in a code repo
- generate documentation as html 
- ignore content from a repo
- create a repo locally and push to GitHub


## What is documentation 

```{note}
We opened this page and discussed the different types of documentation in the table in class
```


[documentation types table](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10606-018-9333-1/tables/1)

from [ethnography of documentation data science](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10606-018-9333-1)

Data Science is only *one* type of programing, but this is still pretty representative. The main difference is that in this case the "target" users  are often data scientists and more technically skilled than the "target" users of, for example, a social media app. This would mean that user-facing docs would vary. 


## Why is documentation so important?

we should probably spend more time on it

![differenc ein time spent vs should](https://media.springernature.com/full/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1007%2Fs10606-018-9333-1/MediaObjects/10606_2018_9333_Fig4_HTML.png?as=webp)

[source](https://bids.berkeley.edu/news/most-developers-think-we-should-spend-more-time-documentation)



## What is a docstring

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
python
```

```{code-block} Python
Python 3.11.4 (main, Jul  5 2023, 09:00:44) [Clang 14.0.6 ] on darwin
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> help(print)

>>> def ex():
...    ''' doc string
...    '''
...    padd
... 
>>> help(ex)

>>> 
>>> # a comment
>>> exit()
```


## So, how do we do it? 

[Documenation Tools](https://docathon.github.io/docathon/pages/resources.html#documentation-tools)



[write the docs](https://www.writethedocs.org/)

[linux kernel uses sphinx](https://lwn.net/Articles/705224/) and here is [why](https://lwn.net/Articles/692704/) and [how it works](https://lwn.net/Articles/692705/)


## Install Jupyter-book



[Jupyterbook](https://jupyterbook.org/intro.html) wraps sphinx and uses markdown instead of restructured text. The project authors [note in the documenation](https://jupyterbook.org/en/stable/explain/sphinx.html) that it "can be thought of as an *opinionated distribution of Sphinx*". We're going to use this, so that we can use most of the power of sphinx without having to learn ReStructured Text which is more complex than markdown syntax. 

[install jupyterbook](https://jupyterbook.org/en/stable/start/overview.html#install-jupyter-book) on Mac or linux those instructions will work on your regular terminal, if you have python installed. On Windows those instructions will work in the Anaconda prompt or any other terminal that is set up with python. If these steps do not make sense see the [recommendations](https://introcompsys.github.io/spring2023/syllabus/tools.html#recommendation) in the syllabus for more instructions including videos of the Python install process in both Mac and Windows.

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
pip install jupyter-book
```

```{note}
this command does a lot of stuff, it installs `jupyter-book` and all of its dependencies, which is a lot.  I removed the output from the notes

the thing that matters is that near the end it will say "successfully installed"
```

Now we move to our inclass repo:

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
cd Documents/inclass/systems/
ls
```

```{code-block} console
github-inclass-fa23-brownsarahm
```

And note that we can see the other folders we have made so far, but note that we are *not inside* any of them. 


We can create this
```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
jupyter-book create tiny-book
```

```{code-block} console

===============================================================================

Your book template can be found at

    tiny-book/

===============================================================================

```
and it tells us the relative path to the new folder, we can use `ls` again to see that it is there. 

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
ls
```

```{code-block} console
github-inclass-fa23-brownsarahm	tiny-book
```

## Parts of a Jupyer book

First we go in the directory: 


```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
cd tiny-book/
```

Then look

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
ls
```

```{code-block} console
_config.yml		logo.png		notebooks.ipynb
_toc.yml		markdown-notebooks.md	references.bib
intro.md		markdown.md		requirements.txt
```

### starting a git repo locally 

Before we work with the files, let's commit the current version

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
git status
```

```{code-block} console
fatal: not a git repository (or any of the parent directories): .git
```
We cannot check status because we are not in a git repo. 

Recall a git repo is a folder that contains a `.git` directory with the versions of our project in it. This directory is typically hidden, so to confirm it is not there we need the `-a` option on `ls`

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
ls -a
```

```{code-block} console
.			intro.md		notebooks.ipynb
..			logo.png		references.bib
_config.yml		markdown-notebooks.md	requirements.txt
_toc.yml		markdown.md
```

(gitinit)=
We can create a new repo with `git init` and the  path to wher we want it.  We want it at our current working directory, which is `.`
```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
git init .
```

```{code-block} console
hint: Using 'master' as the name for the initial branch. This default branch name
hint: is subject to change. To configure the initial branch name to use in all
hint: of your new repositories, which will suppress this warning, call:
hint: 
hint: 	git config --global init.defaultBranch <name>
hint: 
hint: Names commonly chosen instead of 'master' are 'main', 'trunk' and
hint: 'development'. The just-created branch can be renamed via this command:
hint: 
hint: 	git branch -m <name>
Initialized empty Git repository in /Users/brownsarahm/Documents/inclass/systems/tiny-book/.git/
```


Here we are faced with a social aspect of computing that is *also* a good reminder about how git actually works 

(nomaster)=
### Retiring racist language
Historically the default branch was called master.

- [derived from a master/slave analogy](https://mail.gnome.org/archives/desktop-devel-list/2019-May/msg00066.html) which is not even how git works, but was adopted terminology from other projects
- [GitHub no longer does](https://github.com/github/renaming)
- [the broader community is changing as well](https://sfconservancy.org/news/2020/jun/23/gitbranchname/)
- [git allows you to make your default not be master](https://lore.kernel.org/git/pull.656.v4.git.1593009996.gitgitgadget@gmail.com/)
- [literally the person who chose the names "master" and "origin" regrets that choice](https://twitter.com/xpasky/status/1271477451756056577) the name main is a more accurate and not harmful term and the current convention.  





we'll change our default branch to main
```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
git branch -m main
```


Now, we can look at the directory to see how `git init` changed the folder. 

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
ls -a
```

```{code-block} console
.			_toc.yml		markdown.md
..			intro.md		notebooks.ipynb
.git			logo.png		references.bib
_config.yml		markdown-notebooks.md	requirements.txt
```

Now we have the `.git` directory! 

and 


```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
git status
```

```{code-block} console
On branch main

No commits yet

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
	_config.yml
	_toc.yml
	intro.md
	logo.png
	markdown-notebooks.md
	markdown.md
	notebooks.ipynb
	references.bib
	requirements.txt

nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)
```
it works!


and we will commit the template.
```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
git add .
```

````{margin}
```{note}

This is GitBash telling you that git is helping.  Windows uses two characters for a new line `CR` (cariage return) and `LF` (line feed).
Classic Mac Operating system used the `CR` character.  Unix-like systems (including MacOS X) use only the `LF` character. 
If you try to open a file on Windows that has only `LF` characters, Windows will think it's all one line. To help you, 
since git knows people collaborate across file systems, when you check out files from the git database (`.git/` directory)
git replaces `LF` characters with `CRLF` before updating your working directory. 

When working on Windows, when you make a file locally, each new line will have `CRLF` in it. If your collaborator
(or server, eg GitHub) runs not a unix or linux based operating system (it almost certainly does) these extra 
characters will make a mess and make the system interpret your code wrong. To help you out, 
git will automatically, for Windows users, convert `CRLF` to `LF` when it adds
your work to the index (staging area). Then when you push, it's the compatible version. 

[git documentation of the feature](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Customizing-Git-Git-Configuration#Formatting-and-Whitespace) 
this is added to a [new Windows page under resources](../resources/windows.md)
```
````

### Structure of a Jupyter book

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
ls
```

```{code-block} console
_config.yml		logo.png		notebooks.ipynb
_toc.yml		markdown-notebooks.md	references.bib
intro.md		markdown.md		requirements.txt
```


A jupyter book has two required files (`_config.yml` and `_toc.yml`), some for content, and some helpers that are common but not required. 

- [config defaults](https://jupyterbook.org/customize/config.html#configuration-defaults)
- [toc file formatting rules](https://jupyterbook.org/structure/toc.html#structure-of-a-book)
- the `*.md` files are content
- the `.bib` file is bibiolography information
- The other files are optional, but common. [Requirements.txt](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/user_guide/#requirements-files) is the format for pip to install python depndencies. There are different standards in other languages for how


the extention (`.yml`) is [yaml](https://yaml.org/), which stands for "YAML Ain't Markup Language". It consists of key, value pairs and is deigned to be a human-friendly way to encode data for use in any programming language.


### Dev tools mean we do not have to write bibliographies manually

bibliographies are generated with [bibtex](http://www.bibtex.org/) which takes structured information from the references in a [bibtex file](http://www.bibtex.org/Format/) with help from [sphinxcontrib-bibtex](https://sphinxcontrib-bibtex.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

For general reference, reference managers like [zotero](https://www.zotero.org/) and [mendeley](https://www.mendeley.com/) can track all of your sources and output the references in bibtex format that you can use anywhere or sync with tools like MS Word or Google Docs. 


### Configuration options

The config file template is pretty complete, including the URL of the webpage with all of the detailed setting options. 

The configuration file, tells jupyter-book basic iformation about the book, it provides all of the settings that jupyterbook and sphinx need to render the content as whatever output format we want.



```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
cat _config.yml 
```

```{code-block} console
# Book settings

  use_repository_button: true
```


### Content Organization

The table of contents file describe how to put the other files in order.


```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
cat _toc.yml 
```

```{code-block} console
# Table of contents
# Learn more at https://jupyterbook.org/customize/toc.html

format: jb-book
root: intro
chapters:
- file: markdown
- file: notebooks
- file: markdown-notebooks
```

### Building a book

We can transform from raw source to an output by **building** the book 

Building is transforming from input to output format.  In this case from markdown, yaml, and notebook files into HTML.  

We will see later that building is also what we refer to the whole process from source code to executable. 

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]

You can look at your book by opening this file in a browser:
    _build/html/index.html

```

```{admonition} Try it yourself
Which files created by the template are not included in the rendered output? How could you tell?
```

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
ls
```

```{code-block} console
_build			logo.png		references.bib
_config.yml		markdown-notebooks.md	requirements.txt
_toc.yml		markdown.md
intro.md		notebooks.ipynb
```
we note that this made a new folder called `_build`. we can look inside there. 

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
ls _build/
```

```{code-block} console
html		jupyter_execute
```
and in the html folder: 

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
ls _build/html/
```

```{code-block} console
_images			index.html		objects.inv
_sources		intro.html		search.html
_sphinx_design_static	markdown-notebooks.html	searchindex.js
_static			markdown.html
genindex.html		notebooks.html
```
We got HTML, CSS, and javascript files without having to write them manually. 

We can also copy the path to the file and open it in our browser

we can change the size of a browswer window or use the screen size settings in inspect mode to see that this site is responsive. 

We didn't have to write any html and we got a responsive site!



If you wanted to change the styling with sphinx you can use built in
[themes](https://sphinx-themes.org/) which tell sphinx to put different
files in the `_static` folder when it builds your site, but you don't have to change any of your content!  If you like working on front end things (which is great! it's just not alwasy the goal) you can even
build [your own theme](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/development/theming.html) that can work with sphinx.



## Ignoring Built files

The built site files are compeltey redundant, content wise, to the original markdown files. 

We do not want to keep track of changes for the built files since they are generated from the source files. It's redundant and makes it less clear where someone should update content. 


```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
git status
```

```{code-block} console
On branch main
Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
	_build/

nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)
```


```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
ls
```

```{code-block} console
_build			logo.png		references.bib
_config.yml		markdown-notebooks.md	requirements.txt
_toc.yml		markdown.md
intro.md		notebooks.ipynb
```

Git helps us with this with the .gitignore

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
echo "_build/" >> .gitignore
```




```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
git status
```

```{code-block} console
On branch main
Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
	.gitignore

nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)
```

now that's the only new file as far as git is concerned, so we will track this,


```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
git add .
```


```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
git commit -m 'ignores build'
```

```{code-block} console
[main 9c4157f] ignores build
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)
 create mode 100644 .gitignore
```

We can look at the file's contents
```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
cat .gitignore 
```

```{code-block} console
_build/
```

What it does is, when git goes to add, it skips any specific files that match both the `git add <path>` AND any of the paths listed in `.gitignore`



## How do I push a repo that I made locally to GitHub?


Right now, we do not have any remotes

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
git remote
```


If we do the same in another repo that we got by cloing *from* GitHub, they all have remotes. 

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
cd ../github-inclass-fa23-brownsarahm/
git remote
```

```{code-block} console
origin
```
Typically they all use the default name `origin`

Back to our `tiny-book`

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
cd ../tiny-book/
```


For today, we will create an empty github repo shared with me using the link shared on prismia.

More generally, you can [create a repo](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/create-a-repo)

That default page for an empty repo if you do not initiate it with any files will give you the instructions for what remote to add.

Now we add the remote, following the instructions from the blank repo page. 

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
git remote add origin https://github.com/introcompsys/f23-tiny-book-brownsarahm.git
```

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
git branch -M main
```
and finally we can push!

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
git push -u origin main
```

```{code-block} console

## Experience Report Evidence
Tiny book repo should exist. Append your terminal output or this repo's git log  to your experience report. 

## Questions After Today's Class 

### Why would one experience missing .exe files within their python library, even after reinstalling python?

it is probably a missing path


### If I want to track the _build file will it automatically be tracked now or do I have to remove it from gitignore?

To track the files in the build directory you would need to delete it from the `.gitignore` file. 

Also, of note, git does not track folders, it tracks files, but listing folder paths can help 

### Will jupyter book look for a universal syntax for documentation or will it look for a language dependent syntax?

Default it works with Python, but the [sphinx docs](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/tutorial/describing-code.html#other-languages-c-c-others) describe how to work with other languages. The jupyter book docs include a page on how [sphinx and jupyter-book](https://jupyterbook.org/en/stable/explain/sphinx.html) are related and a [page on how to use other sphinx features in a jupyter book](https://jupyterbook.org/en/stable/advanced/sphinx.html).

Jupyter notebooks also have [alternative kernels](https://docs.jupyter.org/en/latest/projects/kernels.html) so notebook styled pages can be written in these languages as well. 

### Can you create an entire repository with only git?

By definition git is what makes a git repository. 

### What is jupyter used for

Jupyter is a large software project designed to support computational sciences. 

it includes the notebook file format specification, the lab interface for working with them, the hub for hosting it on a server.  

Jupyter-book is a separate, but related, project that is highly compatible. 

### My question is related to hooking up to remote. It might be irrelavent now but could be a learning experience, I had trouble setting up my xcode local git repo with github, it kept giving an error about needing a ssh, eventually I got it working using some tutorials online but I'm wondering what would have made that happen.

This sounds like you may have copied the ssh url to the remote instead of the https version?

### So pip3 install jupyter-book ended up not working up on Git Bash so I had to install Anaconda.Navigator. Now I am using the powershell prompt there. Should I expect massive differences even though I managed to catch up via the commands you posted in Prismia?

Python things do not work in GitBash by default, but do work in Anaconda Prompt, where git operations do not work. You may need to use two terminals, but should be able to do everything you need. 

### Is it possible to edit the Jupyter Book website on a web front site or does it have to be in the files?

You have to edit the source files not the built ones to keep the changes. 

You can however, add custom HTML and/or CSS. 

### Are their alternatives to Jupyterbook that have similar functionality?

Yes, this is the practice badge. 

### If I want to track the _build file will it automatically be tracked now or do I have to remove it from gitignore?

It has to not be in .gitignore to be tracked. 

### Will jupyter book look for a universal syntax for documentation or will it look for a language dependent syntax?

By default it looks for Python, but you can configure it to work with other languages.  

```{important}
This is one thing you could do for a build badge. 
```

## Good Questions for Explore Badges

### What other platforms/libraries are used to generate similar webpages?

Learning about the landscape of static site generators is a great topic.
