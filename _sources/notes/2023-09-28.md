## Questions After Today's Class 

Class Response Summary:



• I was unable to install jupyter books for a while so I'm not caught up, is it complicated to navigate?

• I wonder why when I ran "pip3 install jupyter-book" and the install completed, but then when I try using the jupyter-book commands, it would say command not found.....

• If I want to track the _build file will it automatically be tracked now or do I have to remove it from gitignore?

• Will jupyter book look for a universal syntax for documentation or will it look for a language dependent syntax?

• Can you create an entire repository with only git?

• What is jupyter used for

• just right

• My question is related to hooking up to remote. It might be irrelavent now but could be a learning experience, I had trouble setting up my xcode local git repo with github, it kept giving an error about needing a ssh, eventually I got it working using some tutorials online but I'm wondering what would have made that happen.

• So pip3 install jupyter-book ended up not working up on Git Bash so I had to install Anaconda.Navigator. Now I am using the powershell prompt there. Should I expect massive differences even though I managed to catch up via the commands you posted in Prismia?

• I had a separate install issue with jupyter-book. I was provided with a variety of errors that I tried to trouble shoot. I'll see if I can fix it during lab tomorrow or before then
