# How do git branches work?


## Review

Recall, We can move around and examine the computer's file structure using shell commands.
```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
cd Documents/inclass/systems/github-inclass-fa23-brownsarahm/
```


To confirm our current working directory we print it with `pwd`
```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
pwd
```


```{code-block} console
/Users/brownsarahm/Documents/inclass/systems/github-inclass-fa23-brownsarahm
```
this confirms what we expect

Now let's see what is in our folder: 

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
ls
```

```{code-block} console
README.md	about.md
```
and check in with git

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
git status
```

```{code-block} console
On branch 1-create-an-about-file
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/1-create-an-about-file'.

nothing to commit, working tree clean
```
this is as we left off. 


## Branches do not sync automatically 

Now we will look in GitHub and see what is there. 

```{warning}
the step below requires that you have the `gh` CLI. On windows with GitBash, you have not needed this, and it can be  bit tricky to install.  If you get it done and working well, and you submit instructions to this repo about how to get it set up, for either a community badge (if it's simple) or an explore badge if it takes a lot
```

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
gh repo view --web
```

```{code-block} console
Opening github.com/introcompsys/github-inclass-fa23-brownsarahm in your browser.
```

On Github, we see that it matches the branch we were on because we had merged in our PR in class on Thursday. 


```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
git status
```

```{code-block} console
On branch 1-create-an-about-file
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/1-create-an-about-file'.

nothing to commit, working tree clean
```

Back on our local computer, we will go back to the main branch, using `git checkout`

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
git checkout main
```

```{code-block} console
Switched to branch 'main'
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'.
```

now we look at the status of our repo: 

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
ls
```

```{code-block} console
README.md
```

the file is missing.  It said it was up to date with origin main, but that is the most recent time we checked github only.  It's up to date with our local record of what is on GitHub, not the current GitHub. 


Next, we will update locally, with `git fetch`

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
git fetch
```

```{code-block} console
remote: Enumerating objects: 1, done.
remote: Counting objects: 100% (1/1), done.
remote: Total 1 (delta 0), reused 0 (delta 0), pack-reused 0
Unpacking objects: 100% (1/1), 646 bytes | 215.00 KiB/s, done.
From https://github.com/introcompsys/github-inclass-fa23-brownsarahm
   6a12db0..caeacb5  main       -> origin/main
```


Here we see 2 sets of messages.  Some lines start with "remote" and other lines do not. 
The "remote" lines are what `git` on the GitHub server said in response to our request and the 
other lines are what `git` on your local computer said. 

So, here, it counted up the content, and then sent it on GitHub's side. On the local side, it unpacked (remember git compressed the content before we sent it). It describes the changes that were made on the 
GitHub side, the main branch was moved from one commit to another. So it then updates the local main branch accordingly ("Updating 6a12db0..caeacb5").
  
We can see that this updates th working directory too: 

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
ls
```

```{code-block} console
README.md
```
no changes yet. `fetch` updates the .git directory so that git knows more, but does not update our local file system. 



We can use git pull to fully update. 


```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
git pull
```

```{code-block} console
Updating 6a12db0..caeacb5
Fast-forward
 about.md | 2 ++
 1 file changed, 2 insertions(+)
 create mode 100644 about.md
```


```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
ls
```

```{code-block} console
README.md	about.md
```


```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
git status
```

```{code-block} console
On branch main
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'.

nothing to commit, working tree clean
```

Now we will follow the instruction sin the README issue, commit to a new branch with `closes #x` where x is the issue number in the comment and make  PR. 

Merge the PR and then the issue closes. 

## Pull will downlaod and update

We will `git pull` again now all at once, this will do the work that fetch did before and the checkout. 
```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
git pull
```

```{code-block} console
remote: Enumerating objects: 6, done.
remote: Counting objects: 100% (6/6), done.

this is a program, we can use enter/down arrow to move through it and then `q` to exit. 

```{code-cell} bash

```

## making a new branch locally

We've used `git checkout` to switch branchs before.  To also create a branch at the same time, we use the `-b` option. 

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
git checkout -b fun_fact
```

```{code-block} console
Switched to a new branch 'fun_fact'
```


```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
git log
```

```{note}
notice where each branch pointer is
```

```{code-block} console

commit 6a12db0035e7c73772f7b2348b80dd0bfb3a2a2e
```



we used the [nano text editor](https://www.nano-editor.org/dist/latest/nano.html).  `nano` is simpler than other text editors that tend to be more popular among experts, `vim` and `emacs`.  Getting comfortable with nano will get you used to the ideas, without putting as much burden on your memory.  This will set you up to learn those later, if you need a more powerful terminal text editor. 

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
nano about.md 
```

this opens the nano program on the terminal.  it displays reminders of the commands at the bottom of th screen and allows you to type into the file right away. 

Add any fun fact on the line below your content..  Then, write out (save), it will prompt the file name.  Since we opened nano with a file name (`about.md`) specified, you will not need to type a new name, but to confirm it, by pressing enter/return. 

 My file looks like this. 

```{code-block} console
Sarah Brown
2027
- i skied competitively in high school
```


```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
git status
```

```{code-block} console
On branch fun_fact
Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git restore <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
	modified:   about.md

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
```


This is very similar to when we checked after creating the file before, but, notice a few things are different.  
- the first line tells us the branch but does not compare to origin. (this branch does not have a linked branch on GitHub)
- thefile is listed as "not staged" instead of untracked
- it gives us the choice to add it to then commit OR to restore it to undo the changes


We will add it to stage

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
git add about.md 
```


```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
git status
```

```{code-block} console
On branch fun_fact
Changes to be committed:
  (use "git restore --staged <file>..." to unstage)
	modified:   about.md

```

and commit: 


```{warning}
here i gave an example of what to do if you commit without a message. This is not recommended, but important to know how to fix. 
```
```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
git commit 
```

without a commit message it puts you in vim. Read the content carefully, then press `a` to get into ~insert~ mode. Type your message and/or uncomment the template. 

When you are done use `escape` to go back to command mode, the ~insert~ at the bottom of the screen will go away.  Then type `:wq` and press enter/return. 

What this is doing is adding a temporary file with the commit message that git can use to compelte your commit. 


```{code-block} console
[fun_fact 6d4dbd3] add fun fact
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)
```

Now we can look again at where our branch pointers are. 
```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
git log
```

fun_fact moved up to the new commit, but the other branches stayed behind. 
```{code-block} console
commit 6d4dbd33860fceb9c87bd3c4509deff8cecb3f45 (HEAD -> fun_fact)
Author: Sarah M Brown <brownsarahm@uri.edu>

    add fun fact

    Merge pull request #4 from introcompsys/1-create-an-about-file
    
    create and complete about file closes #1

commit 693a2b5b9ad4c27eb3b50571b3c93dde353320a1 (origin/1-create-an-about-file, 1-create-an-about-file)
```

Now we will push to github. 
```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
git push
```

```{code-block} console
fatal: The current branch fun_fact has no upstream branch.
To push the current branch and set the remote as upstream, use

    git push --set-upstream origin fun_fact

To have this happen automatically for branches without a tracking
upstream, see 'push.autoSetupRemote' in 'git help config'.

```

It cannot push, because it does not know where to push, like we noted above that it did not comapre to origin, that was beecause it does not have an "upstream branch" or a corresponding branch on a remote server. 
It does not work at first because this branch does not have a remote. 

git stores its list of remotes in a `.git/config` file

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
cat .git/config 
```

```{code-block} console
[core]
	repositoryformatversion = 0
	filemode = true
	bare = false
	logallrefupdates = true
	ignorecase = true
	precomposeunicode = true
[remote "origin"]
	url = https://github.com/introcompsys/github-inclass-fa23-brownsarahm.git
	fetch = +refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/origin/*
[branch "main"]
	remote = origin
	merge = refs/heads/main
[branch "1-create-an-about-file"]
	remote = origin
	merge = refs/heads/1-create-an-about-file
```

we can see our other branches have `remote = origin` but our new branch is not there. 

To fix it, we do as git said. 


```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
git push --set-upstream origin fun_fact
```

```{code-block} console

```

This time the returned message from the remote includes the link to the page to make a PR. We are not goign to make the PR though

## Merge conflicts

First, in your browser edit the about.md file to have a second fun fact. 

Then edit it locally to also have 2 fun facts. 

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
nano about.md 
```

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
cat about.md 
```

```{code-block} console

- I went to Northeastern
```

now that we have edited in both places let's pull. 

```
git pull
```

```{code-block} console

Updating 6d4dbd3..768dec8
error: Your local changes to the following files would be overwritten by merge:
	about.md
Please commit your changes or stash them before you merge.
Aborting
```

First it does not work because we have not committed. 

This is helpful beacause it prevents us from losing any work. 
```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
git status
```

```{code-block} console
On branch fun_fact
Your branch is behind 'origin/fun_fact' by 1 commit, and can be fast-forwarded.
  (use "git pull" to update your local branch)

Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git restore <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
	modified:   about.md

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
```

we can add and commit at the same time using the `-a` option from the `git commit``

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
git commit -a -m 'second fun fact'
```

```{code-block} console
[fun_fact b378bd1] second fun fact
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)
```

Now we try to pull again

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
git pull
```

```{code-block} console
hint: You have divergent branches and need to specify how to reconcile them.
hint: You can do so by running one of the following commands sometime before
hint: your next pull:
hint: 
hint:   git config pull.rebase false  # merge
hint:   git config pull.rebase true   # rebase
hint:   git config pull.ff only       # fast-forward only
hint: 
hint: You can replace "git config" with "git config --global" to set a default
hint: preference for all repositories. You can also pass --rebase, --no-rebase,
hint: or --ff-only on the command line to override the configured default per
hint: invocation.
fatal: Need to specify how to reconcile divergent branches.
```

Now it cannot work because the branches have diverged.  This illustrates the fact that our two versions of the branch `fun_fact` and `origin/fun_fact` are two separate things.  

```{mermaid}
gitGraph
    commit
    commit
    branch fun_fact
    checkout fun_fact
    commit
    branch origin/fun_fact
    checkout origin/fun_fact
    commit
    checkout fun_fact
    commit
```

the branches have diverged means that they do not agree and that they each have at least one commit that is different from the other.

git gave us some options, we will use [rebase](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-rebase) which will apply our local commits *after* the remote commits. 

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
git pull --rebase
```

```{code-block} console
Auto-merging about.md
CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in about.md
error: could not apply b378bd1... second fun fact
hint: Resolve all conflicts manually, mark them as resolved with
hint: "git add/rm <conflicted_files>", then run "git rebase --continue".
hint: You can instead skip this commit: run "git rebase --skip".
hint: To abort and get back to the state before "git rebase", run "git rebase --abort".
Could not apply b378bd1... second fun fact
```

Now it tells us there is a conflict. 
```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
nano about.md 
```

We see that git marked up the conflict for us by editing the file: 
```{code-block} console
Sarah Brown
2027
- i skied competitively in high school
<<<<<<<<< HEAD
- i started at URI in 2020
=======
- I went to Northeastern
>>>>>>>>> "add fun fact"
```

We manually edit it to be what we want it to be.  We can take one change the other or both.  We will choose both, so my file looks like this in the end. 
```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
cat about.md 
```

```{code-block} console
Sarah Brown
2027
- i skied competitively in high school
- i started at URI in 2020
- I went to Northeastern
```

Now, we do git add, because above it said that was the next step. 

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
git add about.md 
```

and then this was the next thing after that.  

```{warning}
If you got somethign very different at this point, run `git --version`  mine is 2.41.  If yours is different, let me know as an issue. 
```

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
git rebase --continue
```

```{code-block} console
[detached HEAD 756c487] second fun fact
 1 file changed, 2 insertions(+)
Successfully rebased and updated refs/heads/fun_fact.
```

Once we rebase and everything is done, we can push. 

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
git push

## Questions After Today's Class 

### How would you fix a merge conflict involving other people trying to commit on other systems?

The same way we did in class. 

###  are there situations where if you accidently make another branch, that you can merge it can into the one you wanted to be working on?

yes, exactly! 


###  could you fix a merge conflict in github rather than in the local terminal in some cases? 

Yes, when the merge conflict arises as a result of a pull request and it is simple you can resolve it in github.com

###  What exactly does the rebase command do?

I described it in more detail above with links to git docs. 

###  What point does using git locally give?

it's the only way to keep your work in git and also run code locally

###  Why were some of my command prompts different from yours?

Not sure, but it might be the version of git. 

###  What website do you find the most useful to resolve issues relating to git within the terminal?

I tend to rely on using `git status` to see where it is at, thinking about where I want to get and then searching and using eg stackoverflow for things I do not know how to do. 


that said [git gud](https://nic-hartley.github.io/git-gud/) can help you visualize and we will have some other visualizations  soon. 

###  Would it be reasonable to never use the local Terminal and just always use github?

No, that means you would not be able to run your code to work.  Even if you work on most clous services, you still need to use the "local" terminal, on that cloud instance.
