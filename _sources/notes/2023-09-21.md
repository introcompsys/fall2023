# When do I get an advantage from git and bash? 

so far we have used git and bash to accomplish familiar goals, and git and bash feel like just extra work for familiar goals. 


Today, we will start to see why git and bash are essential skills: they give you efficiency gains and time traveling super powers (within your work only, sorry)


```{admonition} Further Reading

- [bash](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/index.html)
- [git](https://git-scm.com/docs)
```

## Setup

First, we'll go back to our github inclass folder 

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
cd Documents/inclass/systems/github-inclass-fa23-brownsarahm/
```

and we will make sure we are in sync with GitHub.  We know we *can* fix it, but it is best to not break it. 


```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
git status
```

```{code-block} console
On branch fun_fact
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/fun_fact'.

nothing to commit, working tree clean
```

Since our working tree is clean, now we can get updates from GitHub 

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
git pull
```

```{code-block} console
Already up to date.
```

Now let's go back to the main branch. 

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
git checkout main
```

```{code-block} console
Switched to branch 'main'
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'.
```

It tells us we are there. 


Let's look at what commits are on the main branch. 

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
git log
```

```{code-block} console
commit 5c8aaa9f2a129d551b8cb2cb294676f63c4af410 (HEAD -> main, origin/main, origin/HEAD)

Author: Sarah M Brown <brownsarahm@uri.edu>
Date:   Thu Sep 14 13:36:03 2023 -0400
```

We remember that we had added fun facts and none of our commits about those are here, so the fun_fact branch is still ahead of the main branch. 

It's something like this: 

````{margin}
```{note}
This diagram is generated with [mermaid](https://mermaid.js.org/syntax/gitgraph.html). Since small diagrams are often the best way to express an idea, [GitHub supports mermaid](https://github.blog/2022-02-14-include-diagrams-markdown-files-mermaid/) everywhere it supports markdown (files, comments, issues, etc). You can also draft them live with [mermaid.live](https://mermaid.live/) and from there export them as other styles. 

```
````

```{mermaid}
gitGraph

    checkout fun_fact
    commit
    branch origin/fun_fact
    commit
    checkout fun_fact
    commit
    merge origin/fun_fact
```


## Merging a branch offline

We can merge branches locally, without making a pull request in GitHub. 

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
git merge fun_fact
```

```{code-block} console
Updating 5c8aaa9..756c487
Fast-forward
 about.md | 4 ++++
 1 file changed, 4 insertions(+)
```
It summarizes the changes. 

Now we can use `git log` to see where our branches all point. 

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
git log
```

```{code-block} console

    closes #2

commit 65e9e39935be8400ef12cc9003592f12244b50da (origin/add-name)
```

Visually, it is like this 
```{mermaid}
gitGraph
    commit id:"0"
    commit id:"1"
    commit id:"2"
    commit id:"3"
    branch fun_fact

    branch origin/fun_fact
    commit id:"B"
    checkout fun_fact
    merge origin/fun_fact
    commit id:"C"
    checkout main
    merge fun_fact
```

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
git status
```

```{code-block} console
On branch main
Your branch is ahead of 'origin/main' by 3 commits.
  (use "git push" to publish your local commits)

nothing to commit, working tree clean
```
It is ahead by 3 commits now because there were 3 commits on the fun_fact branch. 

## Organizing a project (workign with files)

A common question is about how to organize projects.  While our main focus
in this class session is the `bash` commands to do it, the _task_ that we are
going to do is to organize a hypothetical python project



next we are going to pretend we worked on the project and made a bunch of files 

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
touch abstract_base_class.py helper_functions.py important_classes.py alternative_classes.py README.md LICENSE.md CONTRIBUTING.md setup.py tests_abc.py test_help.py test_imp.py test_alt.py overview.md API.md _config.yml _toc.yml
```

New bash lessons: 
- `touch` can accept a list of files to create
- a list in bash is space separated with no brackets

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
ls
```

```{code-block} console
API.md			about.md		setup.py
CONTRIBUTING.md		abstract_base_class.py	test_alt.py
LICENSE.md		alternative_classes.py	test_help.py
README.md		helper_functions.py	test_imp.py
_config.yml		important_classes.py	tests_abc.py
_toc.yml		overview.md
```


```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
git status
```

```{code-block} console
On branch main
Your branch is ahead of 'origin/main' by 3 commits.
  (use "git push" to publish your local commits)

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
	API.md
	CONTRIBUTING.md
	LICENSE.md
	_config.yml
	_toc.yml
	abstract_base_class.py
	alternative_classes.py
	helper_functions.py
	important_classes.py
	overview.md
	setup.py
	test_alt.py
	test_help.py
	test_imp.py
	tests_abc.py

nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)
```

## Echo and redirects

`cat` concatenates the contents of a file to stdout, which is a special file that our terminal reads 

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
cat README.md 
```

```{code-block} console
# GitHub Practice

Name: Sarah Brown

[![Open in Codespaces](https://classroom.github.com/assets/launch-codespace-7f7980b617ed060a017424585567c406b6ee15c891e84e1186181d67ecf80aa0.svg)](https://classroom.github.com/open-in-codespaces?assignment_repo_id=11872426)
```

`echo` allows us to send a message to stdout.


```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
ehco "age=35"
```

```{code-block} console
-bash: ehco: command not found
```

For example, we can echo our age
```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
echo "age=35"
```

```{code-block} console
age=35
```


We can also **redirect** the contents of a command from stdout to a file in `bash` like file operations while programming there is a similar concept to this mode. 

There are two types of redirects, like there are two ways to write to a file, more generally: 
- overwrite (`>`)
- append (`>>`)

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
echo "age=35" >> README.md 
```

this command has no output, but we can use `cat` to view the file to see its impact. 

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
cat README.md 
```

```{code-block} console
# GitHub Practice

Name: Sarah Brown

[![Open in Codespaces](https://classroom.github.com/assets/launch-codespace-7f7980b617ed060a017424585567c406b6ee15c891e84e1186181d67ecf80aa0.svg)](https://classroom.github.com/open-in-codespaces?assignment_repo_id=11872426)
age=35
```

Now we see the text at the bottom of the file. 


## commit and add has limitations

Now we have made some changes we want, so let's commit our changes.  

Last class we saw we can add and commit at the same time

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
git commit -a -m 'start organizing'
```

```{code-block} console
[main bc28179] start organizing
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)
```

This is way fewer things than we have done recently (remember we also made all of those files with touch)


lets check `git status` again

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
git status
```

```{code-block} console
On branch main
Your branch is ahead of 'origin/main' by 4 commits.
  (use "git push" to publish your local commits)

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
	API.md
	CONTRIBUTING.md
	LICENSE.md
	_config.yml
	_toc.yml
	abstract_base_class.py
	alternative_classes.py
	helper_functions.py
	important_classes.py
	overview.md
	setup.py
	test_alt.py
	test_help.py
	test_imp.py
	tests_abc.py

nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)
```

The `-a` option on a commit does not add untracked files

We have to explicitly add those files. 

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
git add .
```

Now we can commit the content. 

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
git commit -m 'start organizng for real'
```

```{code-block} console
[main d76bc52] start organizng for real
 15 files changed, 0 insertions(+), 0 deletions(-)
 create mode 100644 API.md
 create mode 100644 CONTRIBUTING.md

 create mode 100644 helper_functions.py
 create mode 100644 important_classes.py
 create mode 100644 overview.md

 create mode 100644 test_alt.py
 create mode 100644 test_help.py
 create mode 100644 test_imp.py
 create mode 100644 tests_abc.py
```


```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
git status
```

```{code-block} console
On branch main
Your branch is ahead of 'origin/main' by 5 commits.
  (use "git push" to publish your local commits)

nothing to commit, working tree clean
```


## Redirect file modes 


Now, let's go back to thinking about redirects. We saw that with two `>>` we appended to the file.  With just *one* what happens? 


```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
echo "age=35" > README.md 
```

We check the file now
```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
cat README.md 
```

```{code-block} console
age=35
```

It wrote over.  One `>` writes to the file in overwrite mode. 


````{margin}
```{tip}
## Conceptual Connection



When we open a file in a program we use functions like
- `fopen` in C
- or `open` in Python


both require a parameter for the name of the file and 
typically we also have to tell it what *mode* to open the file with, and some options are: 
- read
- write
- append

- [Python official docs](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#open)


*C is not an open source language in the typical sense so there is no "official" C docs*
```

````

```{note}
**mode** this is a good vocab term that could be added to the site glossary for a community badge
```

## Recovering from mistakes with git restore

This would be bad, we lost content, but this is what git is for! 

It is *very very* easy to undo work since our last commit.  

This is good for times when you have something you have an idea and you do not know if it is going to work, so you make a commit before you try it. Then you can try it out.  If it doesn't work you can undo and go back to the place where you made the commit. 


To do this, we will first check in with git
```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
git status
```

```{code-block} console
On branch main
Your branch is ahead of 'origin/main' by 5 commits.
  (use "git push" to publish your local commits)

Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git restore <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
	modified:   README.md

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
```


Notice that it tells us what to do `(use "git restore <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)`.  The version of README.md that we broke is in the working directory but not commited to git, so git refers to them as "changes" in the workign directory. 


```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
git restore README.md 
```

Now lets check with git. 


```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
git status
```

```{code-block} console
On branch main
Your branch is ahead of 'origin/main' by 5 commits.
  (use "git push" to publish your local commits)

nothing to commit, working tree clean
```

Our working tree is clean now. 



and it looks like it did before the `>` line. and we can check the file too

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
cat README.md 
```


```{code-block} console
# GitHub Practice

Name: Sarah Brown

[![Open in Codespaces](https://classroom.github.com/assets/launch-codespace-7f7980b617ed060a017424585567c406b6ee15c891e84e1186181d67ecf80aa0.svg)](https://classroom.github.com/open-in-codespaces?assignment_repo_id=11872426)
age=35
```

Back how we wanted it! 


## What are these files?

We can use a redirect to add a bunch of text to the README file. 
```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
 echo "|file | contents |
> > | ------| ------- |
> > | abstract_base_class.py | core abstract classes for the project |
> > | helper_functions.py | utitly funtions that are called by many classes |
> > | important_classes.py | classes that inherit from the abc |
> > | alternative_classes.py | classes that inherit from the abc |
> > | LICENSE.md | the info on how the code can be reused|
> > | CONTRIBUTING.md | instructions for how people can contribute to the project|
> > | setup.py | file with function with instructions for pip |
> > | tests_abc.py | tests for constructors and methods in abstract_base_class.py|
> > | tests_helpers.py | tests for constructors and methods in helper_functions.py|
> > | tests_imp.py | tests for constructors and methods in important_classes.py|
> > | tests_alt.py | tests for constructors and methods in alternative_classes.py|
> > | API.md | jupyterbook file to generate api documentation |
> > | _config.yml | jupyterbook config for documentation |
> > | _toc.yml | jupyter book toc file for documentation |
> > | philosophy.md | overview of how the code is organized for docs |
> > | example.md | myst notebook example of using the code |
> > | scratch.ipynb | jupyter notebook from dev |" >> README.md
```



this explains each file a little bit more than the name of it does.
We see there are sort of 5 groups of files:
- about the project/repository
- code that defines a python module
- test code
- documentation
- extra files that "we know" we can delete.


We can see what it does with `cat`

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
cat README.md 
```


```{code-block} console

```


```{note}
using the open quote `"` then you stay inside that until you close it. when you press enter the command does not run until after you close the quotes
```

We can see how the `"` allows us to go on  multiple lines this way:
````{margin}
```{note}
pressing `enter`/`return` creates more lines and each time we do that, bash puts a `>` at the start of the prompt so that we know that we are still working on the previous command.
```
````
```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
echo "sldkjfds
> 
> 
> 
> 
> 
> 
> 
> 
> 
> "
```

and it will output all of the blank lines
```{code-block} console
sldkjfds










```




## Getting organized


Recall, we have just created a bunch of files. 

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
ls
```

```{code-block} console
API.md			about.md		setup.py
CONTRIBUTING.md		abstract_base_class.py	test_alt.py
LICENSE.md		alternative_classes.py	test_help.py
README.md		helper_functions.py	test_imp.py
_config.yml		important_classes.py	tests_abc.py
_toc.yml		overview.md
```


First, we'll make a directory with `mkdir`
```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
mkdir docs
```


we can use `ls` to see the files that exist

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
ls
```

```{code-block} console
API.md			about.md		overview.md
CONTRIBUTING.md		abstract_base_class.py	setup.py
LICENSE.md		alternative_classes.py	test_alt.py
README.md		docs			test_help.py
_config.yml		helper_functions.py	test_imp.py
_toc.yml		important_classes.py	tests_abc.py
```



## Moving Files

next we will move a file there with `mv` 

We can see how to use this by getting the error when we do not pass any arguments. 


```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
mv 
```

```{code-block} console
usage: mv [-f | -i | -n] [-v] source target
       mv [-f | -i | -n] [-v] source ... directory
```

we get an error message that tells us how to use the command,  it takes two arguments: source and target. 


### Help in GitBash
```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
mv --help
```

```{code-block} console
mv: illegal option -- -
usage: mv [-f | -i | -n] [-v] source target
       mv [-f | -i | -n] [-v] source ... directory
```

This only give a basic version  on mac, but is more on Git Bash

### Getting help on *nix systems

`man` shows the manfile for help for a specific command

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
man mv
```

It opens in a program, then we need to use `q` to exit. 

### Back to moving. 


```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
mv overview.md docs/
```

what this does is change the path of the file from `.../github-inclass-brownsarahm-1/overview.md` to `.../github-inclass-brownsarahm-1/docs/overview.md`


This doesn't return anything, but we can see the effect with `ls`

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
ls
```

```{code-block} console
API.md			about.md		setup.py
CONTRIBUTING.md		abstract_base_class.py	test_alt.py
LICENSE.md		alternative_classes.py	test_help.py
README.md		docs			test_imp.py
_config.yml		helper_functions.py	tests_abc.py
_toc.yml		important_classes.py
```

We can also use `ls` with a relative or absolute path of a directory to list tht location instead of our current working directory. 

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
ls docs/
```

```{code-block} console
overview.md
```


### Moving multiple files with patterns


let's look at the list of files again.


```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
ls
```

```{code-block} console
API.md			about.md		setup.py
CONTRIBUTING.md		abstract_base_class.py	test_alt.py
LICENSE.md		alternative_classes.py	test_help.py
README.md		docs			test_imp.py
_config.yml		helper_functions.py	tests_abc.py
_toc.yml		important_classes.py
```

We have lots with similar names. 


We can use the `*` [wildcard operator](https://tldp.org/LDP/GNU-Linux-Tools-Summary/html/x11655.htm) to move all files that match the pattern. We'll start with the two `yml` [(yaml)](https://yaml.org/)
files that are both for the documentation.

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
mv *.yml docs/
```


Again, we confirm it worked by seeing that they are no longer in the working directory.

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
ls
```

```{code-block} console
API.md			abstract_base_class.py	setup.py
CONTRIBUTING.md		alternative_classes.py	test_alt.py
LICENSE.md		docs			test_help.py
README.md		helper_functions.py	test_imp.py
about.md		important_classes.py	tests_abc.py
```

and that they *are* in `docs`

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
ls docs/
```

```{code-block} console
_config.yml	_toc.yml	overview.md
```


Next we will work on the test files

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
mkdir tests
```

## Renaming Files


We see that most of the test files start with `test_` but one starts with
`tests_`. We could use the pattern `test*.py` to move them all without
conflicting with the directory `tests/` but we also want consistent names.


We can use `mv` to change the name as well. This is because "moving" a file and
is really about changing its path, not actually copying it from one location to
another and the file name is a part of the path.

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
mv tests
```

Here  I pressed tab multiple times trying to get tab complete, but since it was not unique, it showed me the two options. 

```{code-block} console
tests/        tests_abc.py  
```

Then I added `_` and pressed tab again to get it full file name. 


```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
mv tests_abc.py test_abc.py 
```

````{margin}
```{note}
this is why good file naming is important even if you have not organized the
whole project yet, you can use the good conventions to help yourself later.
```
````

This changes the path from `.../tests_abc.py` to `.../test_abc.py` to. It is doing the same thing as when we use it to move a file from one folder to another folder,  but changing a differnt part of the path. 


```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
ls
```

```{code-block} console
API.md			alternative_classes.py	test_alt.py
CONTRIBUTING.md		docs			test_help.py
LICENSE.md		helper_functions.py	test_imp.py
README.md		important_classes.py	tests
about.md		setup.py
abstract_base_class.py	test_abc.py
```

Then we can use a similar pattern to move the files. 


```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
mv test_*.py tests/
```


Now we can confirm that it is how we expect. 
```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
ls
```

```{code-block} console
API.md			about.md		helper_functions.py
CONTRIBUTING.md		abstract_base_class.py	important_classes.py
LICENSE.md		alternative_classes.py	setup.py
README.md		docs			tests
```


```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
ls tests/
```

```{code-block} console
test_abc.py	test_alt.py	test_help.py	test_imp.py
```

## experience badge with a file

1. Run the action to create the branch for today's experience badge
2. Open a PR to propose changes from your prepare work brach *to* the branch for today's experience badge
3. merge that PR
4. See that in your experience badge, the prepare work is now visible
5. fill in your experience badge
6. request a review from the TA that is in your group



## Prepare for Next Class

```{include} ../_prepare/2023-09-21.md
```



## Review today's class

```{include} ../_review/2023-09-21.md
```




## More Practice

```{include} ../_practice/2023-09-21.md
```



## Experience Report Evidence

redirect the history to a file

```
history >> makeup_2023-09-21.md
```

then move the file created to your KWL repo on your experience report branch. 

## Questions After Today's Class 

### How can the "*" be used consistently to move a bunch of file? because we used it with the text infront of the similarity and behind it. i'm just wondering how it's used for multiple files, because it was used both before the similarity and after the similarity.

It fills in for any number of characters. 

### I have some badges from 2 weeks ago that are awaiting a second review after changes had been fixed. 

```{important}
Do not merge an unapproved badge
```

Re-request a review

### can you close pull requests on the terminal?

Not with git because pull requests are not a git feature, but it is a feature of github. The `gh` CLI can do this. 

### If you do mv * will it move all files?

In the current working directory. 

### Are there any other ways of using mv that haven't been covered yet?

No those are basically the two purposes. 

### how often should we be practicing with the terminal for git?

Ideally, you work on badges on at least several of the days we do not have class so that you are working with it close to every day.  

You could also start trying to use them for your other classes. 

### Would it be beneficial to organize files with github rather than bash?

GitHub cannot organize files and doing do in broswer would be slow and difficult.  We will see that GitHub code spaces give us a virtual machine that we can work with.
