# How do I use git offline?


## Open a Terminal 

Use the same one we used in the last class

and move to the folder we made to use as a working directory for in class

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
cd Documents/inclass/systems/
```

```{note}
we did some review, see the last notes instead of recapping that here
```


`..` is a special file that points to a specific relative path, of one level up. 

we can use `cd` and `pwd` to illustrate what "one level up" means

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
pwd
```

```{code-block} console
/Users/brownsarahm/Documents/inclass/systems
```


```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
cd ..
```

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
pwd
```

```{code-block} console
/Users/brownsarahm/Documents/inclass
```

we move to make the current working directory the one, one step prior in the hierarchy with `cd ..`

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
cd systems/
```


## A toy repo for in class

```{warning}
I removed the link from the public notes, but you can get it in prismia
```

**this repo will be for *in class* work, you will not get feedback inside of it, unless you ask, but you will answer questions in your kwl repo about what we do in this repo sometimes** 

**only work in this repo during class time** or making up class, unless specifically instructed to (will happen once in a few weeks)



## Connecting with GitHub 


We have two choices to Download a repository:
1. clone to maintain a link using git
1. download zip to not have to use git, but have no link

we want option 1 beacuse we are learning git



### Authenticating with GitHub



There are many ways to authenticate securely with GitHub and other git clients.  We're going to use *easier* ones for today, but we'll come back to the third, which is a bit more secure and is a more general type of authentication.


1. ssh keys (we will do this later)
1. `gh` CLI / gitscm in GitBash through browser

### Windows (gitbash)

- `git clone` and paste your URL from GitHub
- then follow the prompts, choosing to authenticate in Browser. 

### MacOS X

- GitHub CLI: enter `gh auth login` and follow the prompts.
- then `git clone` and paste your URL from github
 
### If nothing else works
Create a [personal access token](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token). This is a special one time password that you can use like a password, but it is limited in scope and will expire (as long as you choose settings well). 

Then proceed to the clone step. You may need to configure an identity later with [`git config`](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-First-Time-Git-Setup)

### Cloning a repo

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
git clone https://github.com/introcompsys/github-inclass-fa23-brownsarahm.git
```

then we get several messages back from git and GitHub (the remote)
```{code-block} console
Cloning into 'github-inclass-fa23-brownsarahm'...
remote: Enumerating objects: 8, done.
remote: Counting objects: 100% (8/8), done.
remote: Compressing objects: 100% (5/5), done.
remote: Total 8 (delta 0), reused 4 (delta 0), pack-reused 0
Receiving objects: 100% (8/8), done.
```

Confirm it worked with: 
```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
ls
```

```{code-block} console
github-inclass-fa23-brownsarahm
```
We see the new folder that matches our repo name



## What is in a repo?

We can enter that folder

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
cd github-inclass-fa23-brownsarahm/
```


When we compare the local directory to GitHub

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
ls
```

```{code-block} console
README.md
```


Notice that the `.github/workflows` that we see on GitHub is missing,
that is because it is *hidden*.  All file names that start with `.` are hidden.



We can actually see the rest with the `-a` for **all** *option* or *flag*.  Options are how we can pass non required parameters to command line programs. 
```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
ls -a
```

```{code-block} console
.		.git		README.md
..		.github
```
We also see some special "files", `.` the current location and `..` up one directory



## How do I know what git knows? 

[`git status`](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-status) is your friend. 


Let's see how it works: 

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
git satus
```

```{code-block} console
git: 'satus' is not a git command. See 'git --help'.

The most similar command is
	status
```

git give you hits, when you try to use a command that doesn't exist. It is friendly, not scary! 


```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
git status
```

```{code-block} console
On branch main
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'.

nothing to commit, working tree clean
```

this command compares your working directory (what you can see with `ls -a` and all subfolders except the `.git` directorty) to the current state of your `.git` directory. 

this tells us:
-  the branch we are on (`On branch main`)
-  that we have incorporated all changes downloaded from GitHub (`up to date with 'origin/main'`)
-  that our working directory matches what it was after the repo's last commit (`nothing to commit, working tree clean`)



## Making a branch with GitHub.

```{note}
Run the one action in the github in class repo one time to get the issues
```


First on an issue, create a branch using the link in the development section of the right side panel. See the [github docs](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/creating-a-branch-for-an-issue) for how to do that. 


Then it gives you two steps to do. We are going to do them one at a time so we can see better what they each do. 

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
git fetch orign
```

```{code-block} console
fatal: 'orign' does not appear to be a git repository
fatal: Could not read from remote repository.

Please make sure you have the correct access rights
and the repository exists.
```

Since the argument after `git fetch` is the variable anme of a remote, when I splled `origin` wrong, it says that it can't find it. 


First we will update the `.git` directory without changing the working directory using [git fetch](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-fetch). We have to tell git fetch where to get the data from, we do that using a name of a {term}`remote`. 
```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
git fetch origin
```

```{code-block} console
From https://github.com/introcompsys/github-inclass-fa23-brownsarahm
 * [new branch]      1-create-an-about-file -> origin/1-create-an-about-file
```
 then we check status again

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
git status
```

```{code-block} console
On branch main
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'.

nothing to commit, working tree clean
```

Looks like nothing so far. 

Next, we switch to that branch. 

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
git checkout 1-create-an-about-file
```

```{code-block} console
branch '1-create-an-about-file' set up to track 'origin/1-create-an-about-file'.
Switched to a new branch '1-create-an-about-file'
```

and verify what happened


```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
git status
```

```{code-block} console
On branch 1-create-an-about-file
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/1-create-an-about-file'.

nothing to commit, working tree clean
```


## Creating a file on the terminal

The `touch` command creates an empty file. 

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
touch about.md
```

We can use `ls` to see our working directory now. 


```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
ls
```

```{code-block} console
README.md	about.md
```


```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
git status
```

```{code-block} console
On branch 1-create-an-about-file
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/1-create-an-about-file'.

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
	about.md

nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)
```

Now we see something new. Git tells us that there is a file in the working directory that it has not been told to track the changes in and it knows nothing.  

It also tells us what we can do next. Under "Untracked files" it gives us advice for how to handle those files specifically. If we had made more than one type of change, there would be multiple subheadings each with their own suggestions. 

The very last line is advice of what do to overall.  

We're going to do a bit more work first though, by adding conent to the file. 

We are going to use the [nano](https://www.nano-editor.org/) text editor to edit the file

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
nano about.md 
```

On the nano editor the `^` stands for control. 

and we can look at the contents of it. 


```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
cat about.md 
```

```{code-block} console
Sarah Brown
2027
```

Now we will check again

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
git status
```

```{code-block} console
On branch 1-create-an-about-file
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/1-create-an-about-file'.

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
	about.md

nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)
```

In this case both say to `git add` to track or to include in what will be committed.  Under untracked files is it says `git add <file>...`, in our case this would look like `git add about.md`.  However, remember we learned that the `.`  that is always in every directory is a special "file" that points to the current directory, so we can use that to add **all** files. Since we have only one, the two are equivalent, and the `.` is a common shortcut, because most of the time we want to add everything we have recently worked on in a single commit.   


`git add` puts a file in the "staging area" we can use the staging area to group files together and put  changes to multiple files in a single commit. This is something we **cannot** do on GitHub in the browser, in order to save changes at all, we have to commit. Offline, we can save changes to our computer without commiting at all, and we can group many changes into a single commit. 

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
git add .
```


We will use status to see what has changed. 

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
git status
```

```{code-block} console
On branch 1-create-an-about-file
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/1-create-an-about-file'.

Changes to be committed:
  (use "git restore --staged <file>..." to unstage)
	new file:   about.md

```

Now that one file is marked as a new file and it is in the group "to be committed". Git also tells us how to undo the thing we just did. 

```{admonition} Try this yourself
:class: anchor

Try making a change, adding it, then restoring it. Use git status to see what happens at each point
```
````{margin}
```{important}
If you forget the `-m` you will be put into `vi` or `vim` text editor. Press `a` to enter `~insert" mode (that will appear on the bottom of the terminal window), type your commit message, then press `escape` to exit insert mode. Then type `:wq`and press enter/return  to write(save) and quit.
``` 
````
Next, we will commit the file.  We use `git commit` for this.  the `-m` option allows us to put our commit message dirctly on the line when we commit.  Notice that unlike commiting on GitHub, we do not choose our branch with the `git commit` command.  We have to be "on" that branch before the `git commit`. 

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
git commit -m 'create and complete about file closes #1'
```

```{code-block} console
[1-create-an-about-file 693a2b5] create and complete about file closes #1
 1 file changed, 2 insertions(+)
 create mode 100644 about.md
```


```{warning}
At this point you might get an error or warning about your identity. Follow what git says to either set or update your identity using `git config
```

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
ls
```

```{code-block} console
README.md	about.md
```


Remember, the messages that git gives you are designed to try to help you.  The developers of git know it's a complex and powerful tool and that it's hard to remember every little bit.


We again check in with git: 
```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
git status
```

```{code-block} console
On branch 1-create-an-about-file
Your branch is ahead of 'origin/1-create-an-about-file' by 1 commit.
  (use "git push" to publish your local commits)

nothing to commit, working tree clean
```

Now it tells us we have changes that GitHub does not know about. 


We can send them to github with `git push`

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
git push
```

```{code-block} console
Enumerating objects: 4, done.
Counting objects: 100% (4/4), done.
Delta compression using up to 8 threads
Compressing objects: 100% (2/2), done.

   6a12db0..693a2b5  1-create-an-about-file -> 1-create-an-about-file
```

This tells us the steps git took to send:
- counts up what is there
- compresses them
- sends them to GitHub
- moves the `2-create-an-about-file` branch on GitHub from commit `3f54148` to commit `57de0cd`
- links the local `2-create-an-about-file` branch to the GitHub `2-create-an-about-file` branch

## Questions After Today's Class 

### Are the things we learned in the terminal available to revisit later on?

Yes, in these notest!


### what's the difference between git checkout and git pull, i used pull in 305 a lot

`git pull` updates the **same** branch you are on. It calls `git fetch` and then does some extra stuff. `git checkout` switches branches

### What situations would you use the terminal over something like VScode for?

really quick edits where the time spent to open and configure VSCode does not pay off


### Will we learn how to fix mistakes in the terminal? As in commands we did not mean to run

Yes, for the things that can be fixed, we will also see what commands cannot be undone and what safeties are in built into CLI tools. 


### Im curious about the benefits to viewing files in the terminal as opposed to quick viewing them in finder, or other things that seem to be easier outside of terminal

Viewing a file in finder when we know it is really small and only text requires **context switching** which makes it more work.  Using a GUI can be an easier way to start, it is less to remember, but once you know how things work you cannot make them any faster, you have to move your mouse so far, wait for things to load, etc.  The terminal lets you gain speed once you learn.  

You can also automate and script things. 

Finally, sometimes a GUI is a waste of resources that you do not have to spare.
