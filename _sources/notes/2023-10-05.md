# Why are these tools organized this way? 



Today we're going to do a bit more practical stuff, but we are also going to start to get into the philosophy of how things are organized.  

Understanding the context and principles will help you:
- remember how to do things 
- form reliable hypotheses about how to fix problems you have not seen before
- help you understand when you should do things as they have always been done and when you should challenge and change things.

 last class notes were [posted](https://github.com/introcompsys/fall2023/commit/3854e147e6cab8dbab512626061209a2d3f11f03) and [announced](https://github.com/introcompsys/fall2023/releases/tag/c8), but not [linked](https://github.com/introcompsys/fall2023/commit/7bfee3ba98ce7ac25dfc0c4876ba41513fa61f66)
```

```{important}
 An issue or PR is always welcome and worth a community badge if I make a release and the website does not update
```



```{note}
[community badge opp](https://github.com/introcompsys/fall2023/issues/9)

I used mulitple cursors to type out that checklist by copying from the `_toc.yml` file and then editing each line to start `- [ ] fix ` instead of `  - file`

## Why should we study design? 


- it is easy to get distracted by implementation, syntax, algorithms
- but the core *principles* of design organize ideas into simpler rules





+++

## Why are we studying developer tools? 

Recall:


> The best way to learn design is to study examples [Schon1984, Petre2016], and some of the best examples of software design come from the tools programmers use in their own work. 

[Software design by example](https://third-bit.com/sdxjs/)

+++

*note*

- we will talk about some history in this course
- I will not take a "great men of history" approach

This is because: 
- I think that history is important context for making decisions
- Many of these "great men" are actually, in many ways, Not Great^TM 
- It *is* important to remember that all of this work was done by *people* 
- all people are imperfect
- when people are deeply influential, ignoring their role in history is not effective, we cannot undo what they did
- we do not have to admire them or even say their names to acknowledge the work
- computing technology has been used in Very Bad ways and in Definitely Good ways

## Unix Philosophy

sources:
- [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy)
- [a free book](http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/taoup/html/ch01s06.html)

- composability over monolithic design 
- social conventions 


The tenets: 

1. Make it easy to write, test, and run programs.
1. Interactive use instead of batch processing.
1. Economy and elegance of design due to size constraints ("salvation through suffering").
1. Self-supporting system: all Unix software is maintained under Unix.

+++

For better or [worse](http://www.ceri.memphis.edu/people/smalley/ESCI7205_misc_files/The_truth_about_Unix_cleaned.pdf) this is dominant, so understanding this is important. 

Also, this critique is written that unix is not a good system for  "normal folks" not in its effectiveness as a context for *developers* which is where *nix (unix, linux) systems remain popular. 


_"normal folks" is the author's term presumably attempting to describe a typical, nondeveloper computer user_

If you have the `gh` CLI installed and working locally, open the terminal that it works in and navigate to your KWL repo. 

If you do not have that working locally, open a codespace on the main branch of your KWL repo


(I have it working locally and working locally lets me save my terminal output for the notes more easily)

```{important}
This part did not happen in class due to time, but is still important.  

We will see these commands again, but this reference will be useful in lab
```

### Processing issues on the terminal 

We can use a pipe to also get a count of the issues using the `wc` command which is for word count and its `-l` option to count lines instead. 

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
gh issue list | wc -l
```

```{code-block} console
28
```

Or we can filter to get a subset of them using `grep` to filter.  By default `grep` searches std in, so when we use it with a pipe it works well. 

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
gh issue list | grep 'prepare'
```

```{code-block} console
29	OPEN	prepare-2023-10-04	prepare	2023-10-04 02:38:50 +0000 UTC
25	OPEN	prepare-2023-09-29	prepare	2023-09-29 17:52:35 +0000 UTC

```

```{important}
You should have fewer prepare than me, in this list becaues by default we only see the open ones
```

we can use `gh issue list --help` to see more options

```{code-block} console
List issues in a GitHub repository.

The search query syntax is documented here:
<https://docs.github.com/en/search-github/searching-on-github/searching-issues-and-pull-requests>

##  How do we Study (computer) Systems



When we think of something as a system, we can study it different ways:

- input/output behavior
- components
- abstraction layers


+++



These basic ideas apply whether a computer system or not.  We can probe things in different ways.  

In a lot of disciplines people are taught one or the other, or they divide professionally into theorists or experimentalists along the lines.  

People are the most effective at working with, within, and manipulating systems when they have multiple ways to achieve the same goal. 


These are not mutually exclusive, we will use them all together and trade off. 


+++



When we study a system we can do so in two main ways.  We can look at the input/output behavior of the system as a whole and we can look at the individual components. For each component, we can look at its behavior or the subcomponents.  We can take what we know from all fo the components and piece that together.  However, for a complex system, we cannot match individual components up to the high level behavior.  This is true in both computers and other complex systems. In the first computers in the 1940s, the only things they did was arithmetic and you could match from their components al the way up pretty easily.  Modern computers connect to the internet, send signals, load complex graphics, play sounds and many other things that are harder to decompose all at once. Outside of computers, scientists have a pretty good idea of how neurons work and that appears to be the same across mammals and other species (eg squid) but we do not understand how the whole brain of a mammal works, not even smaller mammals with less complex social lives than humans.  Understanding the parts is not always enough to understand all of the complex ways the parts can work together.  Computers are much less complicated than brains.  They were made by brains.



+++



But that fact motivates another way to study a complex  system, across levels of abstraction. You can abstract away details and focus on one representation. This can be tied literally to components, but it can also be conceptual.  For example, in CSC211 you use a model of stack and heap for memory.  It's useful for understanding programming, but is not exactly what the hardware does.  At times, it is even more useful though than understanding exactly what the hardware does.  These abstractions also serve a social, practical purpose.  In computing, and society at large really, we use *standards* these are sets of guidelines for how to build things.  Like when you use a function, you need to know it's API and what it is supposed to do in order to use it.  The developers could change how it does that without impacting your program, as long as the API is not changed and the high level input/output behavior stays the same.  


+++



### Behavior

> Try something,  see what happens

+++


This is probably how you first learned to use a computer.  Maybe a parent showed you how to do a few things, but then you probably tried other things.  For most of you, this may have been when you were very young and much less afraid of breaking things. Over time you learned how to do things and what behaviors to expect.  You also learned categories of things.  Like once you learned one social media app and that others were also *social media* you then looked for similar features.  Maybe you learned one video game had the option to save and expected it in the next one.

Video games and social media are *classes* or *categories* of software and each game and app are *instances*.  Similarly, an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) is a category of software and VS Code, ... are instances.  Also, version control is a category of software and git is an instance. A git host is also a category and GitHub is an instance.  Just as before you were worried about details you transferred features from one instance to another within categories, I want you to think about what you know from one IDE and how that would help you learn another.  We will study the actual features of IDE a=and what you might want to know about them so that you can choose your own.  Becoming a more independent developer you'll start to have your own opinions about which one is better.  Think about about a person in your life who finds computers and technology overall intimidating or frustrating.  They likely only use one social media app if at all, or maybe they only know to make documents in Microsoft word and they think that Google Docs is too much to learn, because they didn't transfer ideas from one to the other.

We have focused on the behavior of individual applications to this point, but there is also the overall behavior of the system in broad terms, typing on the keyboard we expect the characters to show (and when they don't for example in a shell password, we're surprised and concerned it is not working).

+++


### Components

> Take it apart, asess the pieces 


+++



We have the high level parts: keyboard, mouse, monitor/screen, tower/computer. Inside we also tend to know there is a power supply, a motherboard, graphics card, memory, etc.  



We can study how each of these parts works while not worrying about the others but having them there.  This is probably how you learned to use a mouse. You focused your attention on the mouse and saw what else happened.



Or we can take an individual component and isolate it to study it alone.  For a mouse this would be hard. Without a computer attached its output is not very visible.  To do this, we would need additional tools to interpret its output and examine it.  Most computer components actually would need additional tools, to measure the electrical signals, but we could examine what happens at each part one at a time to then build up what they do.



This idea, however that we can use another tool to understand each component is an important one.  This  is also a way to again, take care and study each piece even within a software-alone system without worrying about the hardware.  


+++


### Abstraction

> use a model 

+++



As we talked about the behavior and abstraction, we talked some about software and some about hardware. These are the two coarsest ways we can think about a computer system at different levels of abstraction. We can think about it only in physical terms and examine the patterns of electricity flow or we can think about only the software and not worry about the hardware, at a higher level of abstraction.


+++



However, two levels is not really enough to understand how computer systems are designed.  

![layers](https://www.secplicity.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/AvG0R-1.jpg)



- Application - the software you run.
- Algorithm - the way that it is implemented, in mathematical level
- Programming language - the way that it is implemented for a computer.  
- Machine code translates to binary from assembly.



After the Programming language level, there is assembly.
The advantage to assembly is that it is hardware independent and human readable. It is low level and limited to what the hardware *can* do, but it is a version of that that can be run on different hardware.
It is much lower level.  When you compile a program, it is translated to assembly.  At this level, programs written in different level become indistinguishable. This has much lower level operations. We can do various calculations, but not things like compare. Things that were one step before, like assign become two, choose a memory location, then write to memory.
This level of abstraction is the level of detail we will think about most.  We'll look at the others, but spend much less time below here.



The instruction set architecture is, notice, where the line between software and hardware lives.  This is because these are specific to the actual hardware, this is the level where there are different instructions if you have an Intel chip vs an Apple chip. This level reduces down the instructions even more specifically to the specifics things that an individual piece of hardware does and how they dit.


+++



The microarchitecture is the specific circuits: networks of smaller individual components. Again, we can treat the components as blocks and focus on how they work together. At this level we still have calculations like add, multiply, compare, negate, and we can store values and read them. That is all we have at this point though. At this level there are all binary numbers.  




The actual gates (components that implement logical operations) and registers (components that hold values) break everything down to logical operations.  Instead of adding, we have a series of `and`, `nand`, `or`, and `xor` put together over individual bits.  Instead of numbers, we have `registers` that store individual zeros or ones. In a modern digital, electrical computer, at this level we have to actually watch the flow of electricity through the circuit and worry about things like the number of gates and whether or not the calculations finish at the same time or having other parts wait so that they are all working together.  We will see later that when we try to allow multiple cores to work independently, we have to handle these timing issues at the higher levels as well. However, a register and gate can be implemented in different ways at the device level.


+++



The device (or transistor in modern electrical digital computers) level, is where things transition between analog and digital.  The world we live in is actually all analog.  We just pay attention to lots of things at a time scale at which they appear to be be digital.  Over time devices have changed from mechanical switches to electronic transistors.  Material science innovations at the physics level have improved the transistors further over time, allowing them to be smaller and more heat efficient.  Because of abstraction, these changes could be plugged into new hardware without having to make any changes at any software levels. However, they do *enable* improvements at the higher levels.

## Questions After Today's Class 

### Why would we need to know about the lower layers of hardware and software if there are abstractions in place for us?

This is a great question! 

Most of the time that is exactly the advantage to the abstractions, but you typically need to know about the things at least in the adjacent levels. Some times knowing about more layers can help you make better design choices or understand edge case behavior.  We will see some of those throught the rest of the semester.  

Another part of why we teach these things in a CS degree is so that you can make a more informed choice about what you want to specialize in later, too. 

### what an example of Instruction set architecture

the [x86 isa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86_instruction_listings) is an example. 

### How to install `gh`?

[from their docs](https://github.com/cli/cli#installation)

### How often do software engineers touch machine code?

Software engineers is a very broad category.  If you write drivers, that might be very different than if you write front ends.  

If you write compilers, again another very different amount.  

### how physics play into abstraction

The actual physics of how electricity works is the lowest level of abstraction, or most concrete/least abstract way to describe how a computer works. 


### why do brew and gh keep uninstalling from my terminal?

This might be a setting somewhere in your system that erases or resets things?  If you find the answer to this and add it as an FAQ, that is worth a community badge. 

### Should I install the `gh` CLI?  

You can, it's a little harder on Windows, but possible. 


### What is a GUI based tool?

GUI stands for graphical user interface. Everything on a modern compputer except the terminal is a GUI. 


### Is it useful to create models during the process of development, or is it mostly useful after the fact?

Models are often made before things are built.  Sometimes they are refined after, but usually they are used to guide the development. 


### How deep should we really understand abstraction layers and how useful is it as a developer to know it?

We will see them again and they will come up at least implicitly in other classes as well.  It is important to know that they exist and what they are for sure.  How much you directly interact with them will vary though.  

### How will our view on memory change with abstraction as we get to the higher level classes?

We will talk about the physical device that implements memory later and you will learn more about it again in 411 if you take that.
