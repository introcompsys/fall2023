# Computer Systems and Programming Tools

## About this course

In this course we will study the tools that we use as programmers and use them as a lens to study 
the computer system itself.  We will begin with two fundamental tools: version control and the shell. We will focus on git and bash as popular examples of each. Sometimes understanding the tools requires understanding an aspect of the system. For example, git uses cryptographic hashing, which requires understanding number systems.  Other times the tools helps us see how parts work: the shell is our interface to the operating system.

## Land Acknowledgement

```{important}
The University of Rhode Island land acknowledgment is a statement written by members of the University community in close partnership with members of the Narragansett Tribe. For more information see [the university land acknowledgement page](https://www.uri.edu/about/land-acknowledgment/)
```

The University of Rhode Island occupies the traditional stomping ground of the Narragansett Nation and the Niantic People. We honor and respect the enduring and continuing relationship between the Indigenous people and this land by teaching and learning more about their history and present-day communities, and by becoming stewards of the land we, too, inhabit.
